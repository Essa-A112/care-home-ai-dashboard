The Local Authority District of Liverpool has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 9.45, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The district exhibits a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 61.7%, which is a positive indicator for potential investment. However, there is room for improvement as 30.85% of care homes require improvement according to CQC assessments. Additionally, the lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 15.26% may pose a challenge in terms of demand for care services. The moderate house price growth rate of 6.49% could potentially impact the affordability of care services in the area. Despite these considerations, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Inadequate" at 6.38% is a positive aspect. Overall, while Liverpool shows promise for care home investment, it may benefit from targeted improvements to fully maximize its potential.
