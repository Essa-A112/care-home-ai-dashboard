The Local Authority District of Liverpool has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 47.91, categorizing it as a good prospect. This is primarily attributed to its relatively high percentages of care homes rated as 'Good' and 'Requires Improvement' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The positive SHAP impact from these ratings indicates a strong foundation for quality care provision. Additionally, the moderate house price growth of 8.32% suggests a stable and potentially profitable market for property investment. However, the presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' may pose a risk and require attention to ensure overall quality standards. With a score just above the investment threshold, Liverpool may benefit from targeted improvements to further enhance its investment appeal. Overall, this LAD presents a suitable opportunity for investment, with the potential for growth through strategic enhancements in care home quality and market positioning.
