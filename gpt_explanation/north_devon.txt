The Local Authority District of North Devon has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 11.36, placing it in the "Consider" category. This is primarily attributed to its strong House_Price_Growth of 21.32%, indicating a favorable economic environment for investment. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is at 26.18%, suggesting a potentially high demand for care services. The district also boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 72.41%, indicating a good overall quality of care provision. However, there are areas for improvement, notably the percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" at 20.69%. The presence of a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 6.9% could pose a risk in terms of competition and differentiation. Overall, North Devon presents a promising investment opportunity that may benefit from targeted improvements to further enhance its attractiveness to investors and residents alike.
