The Local Authority District of Babergh has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.18, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Babergh demonstrates a strong positive House Price Growth of 32.86%, indicating a potentially thriving property market. However, the high percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 10.71% and the dominance of CQC Good at 89.29% suggest a mixed quality of care homes in the area. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 26.99% may pose a challenge in terms of demand for care services. On a positive note, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is healthy at Â£24,841, indicating a level of economic stability. Overall, while Babergh shows promise with its property market growth and income levels, the need for improvement in care quality and the lower proportion of elderly residents may require careful consideration. It falls into the category of being considered for investment after potential improvements to address the identified weaknesses.
