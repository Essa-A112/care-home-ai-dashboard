The Local Authority District of Babergh has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 11.00, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mix of positive and negative contributing factors. Babergh benefits from a robust House Price Growth percentage, indicating a healthy property market. Moreover, a significant percentage of residents aged 65 and above suggests a potential demand for care services. However, the relatively high proportion of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with a lower percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' facilities, highlight areas that may need attention. Despite these challenges, the district's Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is promising. While not yet meeting the threshold for immediate investment suitability, Babergh's score suggests it could be a candidate for investment after targeted improvements to enhance care home quality and standards.
