The Local Authority District of Uttlesford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.90, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Uttlesford benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the CQC, indicating a higher quality of care provision. Additionally, the district has a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, while positive for quality, may indicate a saturated market. The moderate house price growth rate could also pose a challenge for investment returns. Given these factors, Uttlesford falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements. While the district has strengths such as good CQC ratings and an aging population, further analysis and potential enhancements are advisable before committing to significant investment in care home facilities.
