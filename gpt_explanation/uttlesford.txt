The Local Authority District of Uttlesford has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.74, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Uttlesford exhibits a moderate house price growth rate, which may present challenges for potential investors. However, the district boasts a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, suggesting a potential demand for care services. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per capita is above average, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. On the downside, the lack of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and a significant proportion classified as "Good" could pose a risk in terms of quality standards. Overall, while Uttlesford shows promise with positive demographic and economic indicators, the need for improvement in care home quality ratings may warrant caution for investors. Further enhancements in care services could potentially elevate Uttlesford to a more attractive investment status in the future.
