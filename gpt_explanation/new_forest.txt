The Local Authority District of New Forest has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.73, categorizing it as falling within the "Consider" range. This score is influenced by several key factors. New Forest benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, indicating a generally good standard of care provision. Additionally, the area boasts a significant percentage of residents aged 65 and above, suggesting a potentially high demand for care services. Moreover, the positive house price growth indicates a stable and potentially lucrative property market. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC is a notable weakness that could impact the overall quality of care in the area. While New Forest does not currently meet the criteria for immediate investment suitability, its promising demographic indicators and growth potential suggest that with targeted improvements in care home quality, it could become a viable investment opportunity in the future.
