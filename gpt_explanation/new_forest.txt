The Local Authority District of New Forest has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.98, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. New Forest boasts a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. Additionally, the area has a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 people, suggesting a somewhat balanced market. On the downside, the percentage of facilities requiring improvement as per CQC assessments is above average, posing a risk to potential investors. Despite this, positive indicators such as solid house price growth and a healthy GDHI per head signal economic stability and growth potential. Overall, while New Forest shows promise for care home investment, the need for improvements in existing facilities may warrant caution. Further enhancements in care quality could elevate its attractiveness for investment.
