The Local Authority District of Rochdale has a notable care home investment potential score of 15.00, driven by several key features. One strength is its high House Price Growth percentage, indicating a favorable environment for property investment. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is another positive factor, suggesting a good standard of care provision in the area. However, Rochdale faces challenges such as a significant proportion of the population being 65 years and older, which could strain care services. Moreover, the lower GDHI per head compared to other areas may impact the affordability and quality of care homes. Investors should consider the potential risks associated with an aging population and the economic factors influencing care home investment in Rochdale.
