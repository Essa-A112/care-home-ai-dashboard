The Local Authority District of Rochdale has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 15.00, categorizing it as a good prospect for investors. This positive outlook is supported by several key factors. Rochdale boasts a robust house price growth of 30.78%, indicating a healthy real estate market conducive to investment. Moreover, a significant percentage of care homes in the area have been rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 63.93%. Additionally, a notable proportion, 34.43%, are identified as requiring improvement, suggesting opportunities for enhancement and potential value growth. However, some challenges do exist, such as a relatively lower percentage of the population aged 65 and above at 16.5%, which may impact the immediate demand for care services. Furthermore, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is reported at 16872, indicating a potential constraint on the affordability of care services for residents. Despite these considerations, Rochdale's overall positive indicators make it a suitable candidate for care home investment, offering a favorable environment for potential returns and growth in the sector.
