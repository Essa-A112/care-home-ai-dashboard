The Local Authority District of Rochdale has shown a promising care home investment potential with a score of 52.47, categorizing it as "Good" for investment. This score is primarily influenced by several positive factors, including a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 63.93%. Additionally, the significant house price growth of 32.95% indicates a potentially lucrative market for care home investments. However, there are areas for improvement, such as the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC at 34.43%. The total population figure of 229,756 could also pose challenges in terms of meeting the care needs of a potentially large elderly population. Despite these considerations, Rochdale's overall positive performance in key indicators makes it a suitable candidate for investment, offering opportunities for growth and development in the care home sector.
