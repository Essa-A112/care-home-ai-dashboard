The Local Authority District of Birmingham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.96, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, standing at 71.16%. However, the presence of a significant portion of care homes requiring improvement (27.34%) is a notable weakness. Additionally, factors such as a lower percentage of population aged 65 and over (13.1%), moderate house price growth (5.63%), and a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head could be contributing to the lower investment potential score. Considering these factors, Birmingham may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the need for improvements in care home quality and the economic indicators.
