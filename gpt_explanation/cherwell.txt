The Local Authority District of Cherwell has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.68, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Despite a positive House Price Growth of 10.75%, the district faces challenges with a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (3.85%) and a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" (84.62%). Additionally, the population of individuals aged 65 and over is at 17.77%, indicating a significant demand for elderly care services. With only 11.54% of care homes rated as "Outstanding," there may be concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. Overall, based on these indicators, Cherwell is deemed unsuitable for investment at this time. Further improvements in care home quality and addressing the aging population's needs could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
