The Local Authority District of Cherwell has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.29, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the district benefits from a robust house price growth percentage of 17.32%, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment, it faces challenges in terms of its Care Quality Commission (CQC) ratings. With a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (3.85%) and a lower proportion of homes rated as good (84.62%) or outstanding (11.54%), the quality of care provision in Cherwell may be a concern for potential investors. Additionally, the relatively lower percentage of residents aged 65 and above (17.77%) could suggest a smaller target market for care home services. Considering these factors, Cherwell is currently not deemed suitable for investment due to the existing care quality issues and demographic considerations. However, with improvements in CQC ratings and targeted strategies to address the aging population, the district may become a more viable investment option in the future.
