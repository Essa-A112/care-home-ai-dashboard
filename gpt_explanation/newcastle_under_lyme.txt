The investment potential score of 40.55 for Newcastle-under-Lyme suggests that this Local Authority District falls into the "Consider" category for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the strong house price growth of 15.51% indicates a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 21.05% is a positive indicator for the quality of care in the area. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC at 76.32% may suggest a competitive market with potentially limited room for improvement. The percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 21.33% indicates a significant market for care services. Overall, while Newcastle-under-Lyme shows promise with its growth potential and quality of care, further analysis and improvements may be needed to fully maximize investment returns. Therefore, it falls into the category of potentially being considered for investment after additional assessment and enhancements.
