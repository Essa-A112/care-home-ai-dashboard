The investment potential score for Leicester, with a value of 36.62, places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential care home investments in this area. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Notable strengths include a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC data, which is a positive indicator. However, weaknesses such as a relatively low proportion of the population aged 65 and over, lower house price growth rates, and a higher percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC all negatively impact the investment potential. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is on the lower side, further influencing the score. Given these factors, Leicester may not be the most favorable location for care home investments at present. It is advisable to exercise caution and consider other areas with higher investment potential scores for better opportunities in this sector.
