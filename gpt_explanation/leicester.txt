The Local Authority District of Leicester has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.24, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Leicester has shown a healthy house price growth percentage, which could indicate a potentially favorable market for property investment. However, challenges arise from a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over, suggesting potentially limited demand for care home services. Additionally, a significant portion of care facilities in the area require improvement according to CQC assessments, which could pose operational risks for investors. The relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income per head and a large total population further contribute to the cautious outlook for investment in care homes in Leicester. Given these factors, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in Leicester at present, as the overall environment may not be conducive for a successful investment venture without significant improvements in key indicators.
