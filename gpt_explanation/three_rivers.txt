The Local Authority District of Three Rivers has shown promising investment potential with an estimated score of 43.80, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Positive attributes include a healthy House Price Growth of 15.44%, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 19.05%, and a GDHI per head of 32449, all contributing positively to the overall score. However, there are areas for improvement, such as the percentage of CQC Good standing at 71.43%, which has a negative impact on the score. Despite this, Three Rivers demonstrates strengths in economic indicators and care home quality, making it a viable option for investment consideration. With further enhancements in CQC ratings, this district could potentially move towards a more favorable investment rating in the future.
