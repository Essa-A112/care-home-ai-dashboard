Brighton and Hove's estimated care home investment potential score of 2.27 reflects a mixed outlook based on key features. The negative SHAP impact from house price growth, a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, and a sizable population could pose challenges for care home investment. However, the high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes in the area presents a notable strength, indicating a favorable quality of care provision. The relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement is also a positive indicator. Despite these strengths, the aging population trend and potential affordability issues highlighted by the negative house price growth may present risks for future care home investment in Brighton and Hove. Investors should consider these factors when assessing the overall investment potential in the care home sector within this local authority district.
