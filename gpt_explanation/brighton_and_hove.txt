The investment potential score of 29.19 for Brighton and Hove suggests that this Local Authority District falls into the "Avoid" category for care home investments. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of -10.89% in House Price Growth indicates a challenging economic environment for property investments. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of 16.33% of CQC Requires Improvement highlights potential quality concerns in existing care homes. The demographic composition, with 14.23% of the population being 65 years or older, suggests a demand for care services but also indicates a competitive market. On a positive note, the presence of 3.50 care homes per 10,000 residents indicates an existing infrastructure to support care services. However, the overall picture suggests that Brighton and Hove may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investments. Further improvements in economic indicators and care quality may make it a more viable option in the future.
