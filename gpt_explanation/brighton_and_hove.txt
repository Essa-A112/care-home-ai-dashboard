The Local Authority District of Brighton and Hove has been assigned a care home investment potential score of 2.27, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of house price growth, a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, and a significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement all contribute to the lower score. However, the district does boast a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, which is a positive aspect. With a total population of 279,637, the district presents both challenges and opportunities for care home investment. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is recommended to avoid investing in care homes in this area at present. Further improvements in key metrics could potentially shift its classification to one that may be considered for investment in the future.
