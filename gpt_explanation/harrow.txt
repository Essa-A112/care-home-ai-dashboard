The Local Authority District of Harrow has received an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.83, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment at this time. This low score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Harrow exhibits a high percentage of the population over 65 years old, standing at 15.82%, which can increase the demand for care services but may strain available resources. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of 'Good' at 93.1% suggests potential quality concerns. However, the positive house price growth of 12.05% indicates a stable economic environment. With a total population of 263,448, there is a substantial market potential for care services. Overall, while there are opportunities for growth in the care home sector in Harrow, the current conditions suggest a need for improvements before considering investment.
