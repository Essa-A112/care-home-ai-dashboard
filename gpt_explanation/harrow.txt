The investment potential score for Harrow, with a value of 26.55, categorizes it as an area to avoid for care home investments. This classification is likely influenced by several key factors. While the positive impact of a 13.0% house price growth rate is a notable strength, other features such as a high percentage of the population over 65 years old at 15.82% and a relatively low percentage of CQC Good ratings at 93.1% contribute negatively to the score. Additionally, the presence of a small percentage of care homes with CQC Requires Improvement status at 1.72% may pose risks in terms of quality of care services. With a total population of 263,448, the demand for care services may be significant, but the existing quality and demographic factors suggest that investment in care homes in Harrow may not be advisable at this time. Further improvements in care quality and demographic considerations could potentially make this area more suitable for investment in the future.
