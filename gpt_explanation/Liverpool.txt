The investment profile for Liverpool suggests a strong care home investment potential with a score of 9.45, primarily driven by positive factors such as a high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 61.7% and a relatively low percentage of CQC Inadequate ratings at 6.38%. These indicators reflect a favorable quality of care within the district. However, challenges such as a significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and over at 15.26% and moderate house price growth of 6.49% could pose risks to the investment potential. The aging population may increase the demand for care services but also raise concerns about capacity and resources. Additionally, the moderate house price growth may impact the affordability and attractiveness of care home investments in the area. Overall, while Liverpool shows promise for care home investments due to its strong quality ratings, investors should consider the demographic trends and economic factors that could influence the market dynamics in the long term.
