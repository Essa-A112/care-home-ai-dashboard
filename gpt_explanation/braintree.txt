The Local Authority District of Braintree has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.01, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Braintree exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC standards, standing at 24.19%. Moreover, the district has a notable proportion of residents aged 65 and over, which suggests a potential demand for care services. However, Braintree faces challenges such as a negative house price growth rate of -3.75% and a significant percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC, which may indicate a competitive market. While there are no inadequate care homes in the area, the overall score suggests room for improvement. Considering the current score falls below the threshold for direct investment suitability, Braintree could be a candidate for investment after targeted enhancements to address existing weaknesses and capitalize on its strengths.
