The investment potential score for North Tyneside, standing at 6.42, places it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is relatively high at 21.09%, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. Additionally, the presence of a small but notable proportion of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the CQC at 2.22% further suggests a level of quality within the existing care provision. However, challenges exist as well. A relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 15.56% raises concerns about the overall quality of care in the area. Moreover, a lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 at Â£19,171 could potentially impact the affordability and sustainability of care services. Although the positive house price growth percentage of 8.25% indicates a healthy economic environment, the overall mix of strengths and weaknesses suggests that North Tyneside may be a viable investment option after improvements are made to address the existing quality issues.
