The investment potential score for North Tyneside stands at 36.55, categorizing it as one to avoid for care home investments. This rating is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is relatively high at 21.09%, indicating a potentially higher demand for care services. Additionally, the low percentages of care homes rated as inadequate (4.44%) and outstanding (2.22%) are favorable indicators. However, the significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement (15.56%) is a notable weakness that likely impacted the overall score. Furthermore, the modest house price growth of 2.74% may suggest a slower economic growth trajectory, posing a risk for potential investments. Given the overall score falling below the investment threshold, North Tyneside is currently deemed unsuitable for care home investments. Further improvements in care home quality and economic indicators may make it a more viable option in the future.
