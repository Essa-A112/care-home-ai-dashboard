The Local Authority District of Ashfield has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 6.00, influenced by several key factors. One of its strengths is the positive impact from House Price Growth, indicating a robust housing market that could support investments in care homes. Additionally, the relatively high number of Care Homes per 10k residents suggests an existing infrastructure that could attract further investment. However, weaknesses are evident, with a significant percentage of care facilities requiring improvement according to the CQC, potentially indicating quality issues that could deter investors. Moreover, the lower GDHI per head figure suggests a less affluent population, which may pose challenges for private care home operators looking to attract higher-paying residents. Overall, while Ashfield shows promise with its housing market and existing care home infrastructure, addressing quality concerns and economic factors will be crucial to fully realize its investment potential.
