The Local Authority District of Ashfield has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.30, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Ashfield exhibits strengths such as a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents, indicating an existing infrastructure to support elderly care. However, challenges arise from a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC evaluations, potentially impacting the quality of care provided. Additionally, the low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes and the modest GDHI per head figures suggest potential financial constraints and quality issues within the district. Despite a positive indicator in house price growth, the overall profile suggests that significant improvements are necessary before considering investments in care homes in Ashfield. As such, caution is advised in investing in this area until these challenges are addressed to enhance the quality and sustainability of care services.
