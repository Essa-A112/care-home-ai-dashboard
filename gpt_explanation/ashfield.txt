Ashfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.00, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows a positive house price growth percentage, indicating a potentially favorable market for property investment. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement and a lower percentage of those rated as good by the Care Quality Commission suggest potential quality concerns in the existing care home facilities. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is on the lower side, which might impact the ability of residents to afford higher-end care services. While the number of care homes per 10,000 people is relatively high, indicating demand, the overall score suggests that significant improvements may be needed to make this area more attractive for care home investment. As such, at its current state, Ashfield is not considered suitable for investment and may require notable enhancements before being considered for investment opportunities.
