The investment potential score for West Oxfordshire stands at 7.68, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors: a strong house price growth of 11.35%, a relatively low percentage of CQC requires improvement at 16.67%, a significant elderly population of 22.04%, but a slightly lower CQC good rating at 76.67%. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is favorable at 28583. While West Oxfordshire shows promise with its positive house price growth and a sizable elderly demographic, the lower CQC good rating and the percentage requiring improvement suggest areas for potential enhancement. Considering its score falls within the "Consider" range, further improvements in CQC ratings and potentially other factors could elevate it to a more suitable investment level. Therefore, West Oxfordshire could be a viable option for investment after targeted improvements are made to enhance its overall care home investment potential.
