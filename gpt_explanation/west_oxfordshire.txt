The investment potential score for West Oxfordshire, standing at 39.77, places it within the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a positive House Price Growth of 19.15%, indicating a healthy property market. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (16.67%) and the limited proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC (76.67%) present notable weaknesses. On a positive note, the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is 22.04%, suggesting a potentially higher demand for care services. With a score falling in the 'Consider' range, West Oxfordshire may be a viable investment option after careful consideration and potential improvements in care home quality. While it doesn't currently meet the threshold for immediate investment, the district's favorable property market and aging population could offer opportunities for growth with strategic enhancements.
