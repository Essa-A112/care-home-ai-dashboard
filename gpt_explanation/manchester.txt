The Local Authority District of Manchester has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.08, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed profile with both strengths and weaknesses. Manchester's relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, at 21.18%, is a positive indicator. However, challenges arise from a higher percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, potentially increasing demand for care services. The district also has a lower proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC, standing at 71.76%. Furthermore, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents and the Gross Disposable Household Income per head are below the optimal range, indicating potential resource constraints. While Manchester may benefit from strategic investments to address these shortcomings and improve its care home infrastructure, the current score suggests a cautious approach. Further enhancements and interventions could position Manchester as a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
