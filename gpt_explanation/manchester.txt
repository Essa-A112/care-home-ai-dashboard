The investment potential score for Manchester, with a rating of 5.00, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Manchester exhibits a strong positive house price growth rate of 10.26%, which is a notable strength. However, the high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, coupled with a relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income per capita and a large total population, contribute to the negative impact on the investment potential. Additionally, the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents further lowers the attractiveness for investment in this area. Given these factors, Manchester is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment and may require significant improvements to become a viable option in the future.
