The Local Authority District of West Northamptonshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of -3.19, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 57.14%, the area faces challenges such as a significant decline in house price growth at -41.70% and a lower proportion of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 10.71%. The total population of 434,349 also contributes negatively to the score. These factors collectively indicate a less favorable environment for care home investment in West Northamptonshire. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is recommended that caution be exercised in considering care home investments in this area until significant improvements are made to address the identified weaknesses.
