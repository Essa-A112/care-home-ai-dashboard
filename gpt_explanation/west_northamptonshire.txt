West Northamptonshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.20, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district shows strengths in its relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 57.14%, indicating a decent quality of care provided. However, challenges arise from a notable percentage of homes requiring improvement at 30.36%, suggesting areas for enhancement in the quality of care services. The negative impact of a significant decline in house price growth at -18.25% may pose a risk to potential returns on investment. Furthermore, with a total population of 434,349, the district faces the challenge of catering to a large demographic which could strain care resources. Overall, while West Northamptonshire shows promise with room for improvement in care home quality, caution should be exercised due to the negative impact of declining house prices and the large population size. Thus, it falls in the category of being considered for investment after improvements are made.
