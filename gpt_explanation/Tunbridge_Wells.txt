The Local Authority District of Tunbridge Wells has a care home investment potential score of -0.60, indicating a moderate negative outlook. This score can be attributed to several key features within the area. Despite a significant total population of 117,020, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 83.87% is a weakness. Additionally, the lack of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' could be a missed opportunity for higher returns. The high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 16.13% poses a risk to potential investors due to the potential costs of upgrading or maintaining these facilities. The negative house price growth percentage of -21.95% further adds to the challenges, indicating a potential lack of demand or investment attractiveness in the housing market. Overall, while the large population size presents an opportunity for care home demand, the existing shortcomings in care home quality and property market performance suggest caution for investors looking into this area.
