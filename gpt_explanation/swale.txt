The Local Authority District of Swale has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 25.66, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several negative factors, including a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments, a decline in house price growth, and a lower proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by the CQC. These aspects indicate potential challenges and risks associated with investing in care homes in Swale. Given the overall score falling below the investment threshold, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering investment in this area until significant improvements are made to enhance its investment potential.
