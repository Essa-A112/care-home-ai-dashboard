Swale, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.55, falls into the "Avoid" category due to several key factors. The negative impact on the score stems from various aspects such as a decline in House Price Growth, a relatively high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement facilities, and a lower percentage of CQC Good facilities. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 or above is moderate at 19.15%, potentially indicating a demand for care services. However, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively low at Â£21,612, which may limit the ability of residents to afford higher-priced care services. Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that Swale may not be suitable for immediate investment and would require substantial improvements to become an attractive investment opportunity in the future.
