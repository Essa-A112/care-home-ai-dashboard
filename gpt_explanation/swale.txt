Swale, as a Local Authority District, has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.55. The negative impacts on this score are evident through various key features. The house price growth percentage is notably low, indicating a potential stagnation in the local property market. Moreover, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggests potential quality issues within the existing facilities. Additionally, the significant percentage of the population over 65 years old may strain the demand for care services. Despite these challenges, Swale does have strengths such as a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC. However, the low GDHI per head figure indicates potentially limited financial resources within the community. Investors considering Swale should be aware of the need for improvements in care home quality and the demographic challenges posed by an aging population.
