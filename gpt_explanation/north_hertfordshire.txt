The Local Authority District of North Hertfordshire has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.00, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. North Hertfordshire exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 22.86%, indicating a solid foundation in care quality. Moreover, a high percentage of care homes in the district are rated as "Good" by the CQC at 74.29%, reflecting a strong overall standard of care. However, the absence of care homes rated as "Outstanding" and a small percentage rated as "Inadequate" suggest areas for potential improvement. Additionally, the modest house price growth percentage may impact investment attractiveness. Overall, North Hertfordshire presents a balanced profile with strengths in care quality but room for enhancement. While suitable for investment consideration, further improvements could potentially elevate its investment potential to a more favorable level.
