The Local Authority District of Shropshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 11.07, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Shropshire exhibits a strong positive House Price Growth percentage, indicating a potentially thriving property market. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requiring Improvement and a high percentage of CQC Good ratings suggest a favorable quality of care facilities. The significant proportion of the population aged 65 and over further supports the need for care services in the area. However, the total population figure may pose a challenge in terms of demand and competition. Overall, Shropshire falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements, indicating potential opportunities for growth with strategic enhancements to address population dynamics and market saturation.
