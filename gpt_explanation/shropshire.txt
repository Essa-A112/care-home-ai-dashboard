The Local Authority District of Shropshire has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 44.99, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Shropshire benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, coupled with a healthy house price growth rate and a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over. However, the district faces challenges due to a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC and a large total population, which can strain care services. While Shropshire falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, its positive indicators suggest that with targeted improvements, it could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future. Therefore, it may be worth considering for investment after necessary enhancements are made to address the identified weaknesses and risks.
