The Local Authority District of Tamworth has an estimated care home investment potential score of 43.32, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Tamworth demonstrates positive attributes such as a strong house price growth percentage of 23.47% and a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 23.08%. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 76.92% and a lower Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 at 18159 may have slightly impacted the overall score. Notably, there are no care homes labeled as 'Inadequate' in this district, which is a positive indicator. While falling short of the threshold for immediate investment suitability, Tamworth shows promise and could be considered for investment after certain improvements are made to address the identified weaknesses. This LAD presents a balanced profile with room for growth, making it a candidate for future investment consideration.
