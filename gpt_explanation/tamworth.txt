The Local Authority District of Tamworth has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 9.34, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Tamworth exhibits robust house price growth, a positive indicator for potential return on investment. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (23.08%) and a non-existent percentage of outstanding CQC ratings contribute positively to the score. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC (76.92%) and a slightly lower GDHI per head in 2022 could be seen as areas for improvement. Despite these weaknesses, the overall opportunity for investment in Tamworth seems viable, especially with its favorable house price growth and generally positive CQC ratings. With some enhancements in the areas needing improvement, Tamworth could become even more attractive for care home investment in the future.
