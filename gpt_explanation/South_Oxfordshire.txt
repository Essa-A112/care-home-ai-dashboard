South Oxfordshire's estimated care home investment potential score of -0.63 indicates a moderate negative outlook for the region. The district's low House_Price_Growth_% and high %_CQC_RequiresImprovement suggest potential weaknesses in the local housing market and care home quality. On the positive side, the high %_CQC_Good and %_CQC_Outstanding ratings reflect relatively good overall care home quality. The GDHI_per_head_2022 value also indicates a decent level of Gross Disposable Household Income, which could support investment opportunities. However, the negative House_Price_Growth_% and %_CQC_RequiresImprovement may pose challenges for potential investors. It's crucial to consider these factors in tandem to assess the overall investment attractiveness of the care home sector in South Oxfordshire.
