The Local Authority District of Wealden has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 7.90, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key features contribute to this score, such as a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is favorable, suggesting a well-developed care infrastructure. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is also notable, indicating a level of economic prosperity that may support investment. However, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement, though not excessively high, is a point of concern and suggests areas for enhancement in the quality of care services provided. Despite this, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission is a reassuring factor. Overall, Wealden falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements, as it demonstrates both strengths and areas for growth in its care home sector.
