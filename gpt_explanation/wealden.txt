The Local Authority District of Wealden has a relatively high proportion of individuals aged 65 and over, which is a positive indicator for the care home investment potential score. Additionally, the area boasts a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 people, suggesting existing infrastructure to support the elderly population. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is also respectable, indicating a level of financial stability within the community. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission is a concerning factor that may impact the overall attractiveness of the area for investment. Despite this, the significant percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC could potentially offset this weakness and provide assurance to potential investors. Overall, while Wealden shows promise due to its demographic profile and economic indicators, mitigating the issues related to care home quality will be crucial to fully realizing its investment potential.
