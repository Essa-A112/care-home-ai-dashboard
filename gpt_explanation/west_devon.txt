The investment potential score of 7.29 for West Devon indicates a promising opportunity in the care home sector. The district's strong house price growth of 10.49% suggests a healthy local economy, potentially attracting investment and affluent retirees. Moreover, with 29.26% of the population being 65 years and older, there is a significant market demand for care facilities. However, West Devon does face challenges, as indicated by the relatively high percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 13.04%. This could pose operational risks for potential care home investors. Additionally, the lower percentages of care facilities rated as 'Good' and 'Outstanding' by CQC at 78.26% and 8.7% respectively, indicate a need for improvement in care quality standards within the district. Despite these weaknesses, the overall investment potential in the care home sector in West Devon seems promising, given the demographic profile and positive house price growth. Investors should consider these factors while evaluating opportunities in the area.
