The investment potential score for West Devon, with a rating of 7.29, places it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by various key features of the district. West Devon exhibits a positive aspect in terms of House Price Growth, indicating a potential for property value appreciation. However, challenges arise from a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC standards. Furthermore, the lower proportions of care homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" suggest room for enhancement in the quality of care services provided. Despite these drawbacks, the district benefits from a significant population of individuals aged 65 and above, which presents an opportunity for care home investment catering to this demographic. Considering the overall assessment, West Devon could be considered for investment after improvements are made to address the existing issues in care home quality and standards.
