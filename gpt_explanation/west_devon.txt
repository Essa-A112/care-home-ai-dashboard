The Local Authority District of West Devon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.29, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which suggests a potential demand for care home services in the area. Additionally, the strong house price growth indicates a level of economic stability. However, West Devon is marked by a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The high proportion of care homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" is relatively low, posing a risk to potential investors in terms of quality assurance. Considering these factors, it is recommended that West Devon not be considered for investment at this time due to the existing challenges in care home quality within the district.
