The Local Authority District of Winchester has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 6.07, reflecting a mix of positive and negative influences. One notable strength is the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong quality of care provision within the district. Additionally, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is relatively low, further highlighting a generally positive standard of care services. However, the lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' may suggest room for improvement in certain areas. The positive impact of Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 signifies a potentially favorable economic environment for investments. On the flip side, the negative SHAP impact of house price growth could pose a challenge for affordability and returns on property investments in the care home sector. Overall, while Winchester presents strengths in care quality and economic indicators, attention to addressing house price dynamics could be crucial for maximizing investment potential and mitigating risks.
