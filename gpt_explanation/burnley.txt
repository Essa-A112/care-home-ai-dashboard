The Local Authority District of Burnley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.34, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by its low House Price Growth percentage of -25.36, indicating a potential lack of growth in the property market. However, Burnley shows some strengths with relatively low percentages of CQC Inadequate and Requires Improvement ratings, at 5.56% and 19.44% respectively. The high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 75.0% is a positive indicator of existing care home quality. Despite these strengths, the lack of Outstanding CQC ratings and the significant negative impact of House Price Growth suggest that Burnley may not be a favorable location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in property market performance and quality ratings could potentially elevate Burnley to a level where investment may be considered in the future.
