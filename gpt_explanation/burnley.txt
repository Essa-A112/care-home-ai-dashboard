The Local Authority District of Burnley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.17, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by various key features. Burnley exhibits a negative impact on investment potential due to factors such as a decline in house price growth, a lower Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022, and a relatively small percentage of the population over 65 years old. While the district does have a positive attribute with 75% of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), this is outweighed by the high percentage of homes requiring improvement. Given these factors, Burnley is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment and may require significant improvements before reconsideration. Careful consideration of the risks and challenges associated with the current market conditions in Burnley is advised before pursuing any investment opportunities in the care home sector within this district.
