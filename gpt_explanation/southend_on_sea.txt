The Local Authority District of Southend-on-Sea has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.79, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Southend-on-Sea demonstrates strengths in having a relatively high percentage of care homes per 10,000 residents and a positive house price growth percentage. However, the district faces challenges with a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC outstanding ratings impacts its overall investment potential. Considering these factors, Southend-on-Sea falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. With improvements in the quality of care homes and potentially higher outstanding ratings, this district may become more attractive for investment in the future.
