Southend-on-Sea has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.24, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. The district shows strengths in house price growth at 7.54%, indicating a positive environment for property investment. Additionally, with 5.21 care homes per 10,000 people, there is a demand for care services in the area. However, the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (15.79%) and the low percentage of 'Good' rated care homes (82.11%) are concerning factors. While there are no inadequate care homes in the area, the overall quality of care facilities may need enhancement. Due to these factors, Southend-on-Sea is not currently recommended for investment. Improvement in CQC ratings and a more balanced distribution of care home quality could potentially shift its suitability for investment in the future.
