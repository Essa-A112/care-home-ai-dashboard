The Local Authority District of Blackburn with Darwen has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.76, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district shows positive indicators such as a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission and a lower proportion rated as 'Requires Improvement', it is offset by concerning aspects. Blackburn with Darwen exhibits a notable decline in house price growth, a lower percentage of elderly population (65+), and a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head. These factors collectively contribute to its overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability. Therefore, Blackburn with Darwen is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment and may require significant improvements to potentially become a viable investment opportunity in the future.
