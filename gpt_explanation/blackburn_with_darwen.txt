The Local Authority District of Blackburn with Darwen has an estimated care home investment potential score of 32.85, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key features: a notable decline in House Price Growth, a relatively high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings, a lower proportion of the 65+ population, and a significant majority of care homes rated as CQC Good. While the district does have a positive aspect with no CQC Outstanding ratings, the overall assessment suggests challenges in the investment landscape. Blackburn with Darwen may require substantial improvements in various factors to become a more viable investment option. As it stands, due to its current score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised in considering care home investments in this area.
