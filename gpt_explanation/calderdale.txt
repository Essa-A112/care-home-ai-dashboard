The Local Authority District of Calderdale has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.50, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Calderdale shows strong house price growth, which can indicate a potentially buoyant property market. However, the district faces challenges with a relatively lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) compared to those requiring improvement. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively low, which may impact the demand for care home services. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in Calderdale is at a level that could potentially limit the affordability of care home services for residents. Overall, based on these factors, Calderdale is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. However, with improvements in CQC ratings and demographic shifts, there may be potential for reconsideration in the future.
