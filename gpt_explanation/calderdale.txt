The investment potential score for Calderdale, with a value of 34.12, places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential investors. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the positive house price growth of 9.94% presents a favorable aspect, the relatively low GDHI per head of 19489 and the high percentage (14.58%) of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings are concerning. Moreover, despite a high percentage (83.33%) of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes, the absence of any 'Inadequate' ratings does not necessarily offset the need for improvement in a significant portion of care facilities. Given these mixed indicators and the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to approach investments in care homes within Calderdale with caution at this time.
