Reigate and Banstead's care home investment potential score of 34.79 places it in the 'Avoid' category, indicating caution for potential investors. The negative impact of a -10.19% House Price Growth suggests a challenging market environment with declining property values. However, the positive influences of a relatively low % of CQC Requires Improvement at 22.08% and a healthy number of Care Homes per 10k residents at 5.06 indicate a stable care home infrastructure. Despite these strengths, the high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 71.43% may suggest limited room for improvement and growth. With no inadequate CQC ratings, there is a lower perceived risk in care quality. Ultimately, the overall score suggests that while there are positive aspects to the care home market in Reigate and Banstead, the potential for investment may not be favorable at present due to the combination of declining property values and a saturated market with high-quality standards.
