The Local Authority District of Reigate and Banstead has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.93, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The area shows a decline in House Price Growth, which could indicate a less favorable market for property investments. However, a relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" and "Requires Improvement" suggests potential for quality improvements in the sector. The presence of a moderate proportion of the population aged 65 and over may indicate a demand for care services. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is also at a decent level. Despite these strengths, the overall score suggests that Reigate and Banstead may not be ideal for immediate care home investments. Further improvements in housing market conditions and targeted enhancements in care services could make this area more attractive for investment in the future.
