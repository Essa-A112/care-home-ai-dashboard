Sutton, as an Local Authority District, has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.14, placing it in the "Avoid" category for investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. With a relatively low percentage of CQC "Requires Improvement" ratings and a high percentage of "Good" ratings, the existing care home market in Sutton seems stable. However, the low percentage of the population aged 65 and over, combined with modest house price growth and a total population figure, suggests limited potential for significant demand growth in the care home sector. These factors collectively point towards a less favorable environment for care home investment in Sutton. Given the overall score falling below the recommended threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering investment opportunities in this specific district.
