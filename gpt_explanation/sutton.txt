The Local Authority District of Sutton has garnered an estimated care home investment potential score of 24.27, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the district boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 94.67%, the low percentage of homes requiring improvement or rated as 'Inadequate' may limit potential growth opportunities. Additionally, with a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 15.3%, the demand for care services may not be as robust compared to areas with higher aging populations. Moreover, the modest house price growth of 3.22% poses a challenge for potential returns on investment. Given these factors, Sutton may not currently offer an attractive proposition for care home investment. Further improvements in care home quality and an increase in the aging population could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
