The Local Authority District of Horsham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.48, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key features. The low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Requires Improvement" at 7.89% and the high percentage of homes with a CQC rating of "Good" at 78.95% are positive indicators. However, the relatively low house price growth rate of 1.01% and a moderate percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 23.48% contribute negatively to the overall score. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively high at Â£29,440, which is a positive factor. Considering the overall score and feature values, Horsham may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the lower investment potential score and the need for potential improvements in certain areas, particularly in terms of house price growth and the older population percentage.
