The Local Authority District of Horsham has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.75, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Horsham benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a generally good standard of care provision. Additionally, the area boasts a healthy percentage of residents aged 65 and over, suggesting a potentially strong demand for care services. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with a modest house price growth rate, may indicate challenges in attracting investment and improving care home infrastructure. With a Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head of Â£29,440, Horsham shows potential for economic stability. Overall, based on its current profile, Horsham is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to its score falling below the threshold for consideration. However, with targeted improvements in care home quality and market attractiveness, it could potentially become a viable investment opportunity in the future.
