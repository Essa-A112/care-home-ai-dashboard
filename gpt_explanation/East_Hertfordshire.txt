The Local Authority District of East Hertfordshire seems to have a mixed profile when it comes to its care home investment potential score of 1.47. The high percentage of CQC Good-rated care homes at 92.31% is a notable strength, indicating a strong track record of quality care provision. However, the presence of 7.69% of care homes requiring improvement suggests some areas for enhancement. The negative impacts of a slight decline in house price growth and a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and above may pose challenges for the care home market in East Hertfordshire. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively high at Â£29,761, indicating a potentially affluent population that could afford higher-end care services. Overall, while the district has strengths in quality care provision and income levels, it may need to address issues related to property market trends and demographic composition to fully realize its care home investment potential.
