The investment potential score of 4.84 for the Preston Local Authority District reflects a mixed outlook for care home investments. The relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over may indicate a potential weakness in terms of immediate demand for care home services. However, the high proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggests a strength in the quality of existing facilities. The elevated percentage of CQC-rated properties requiring improvement could point to opportunities for investors to enhance underperforming care homes. The moderate GDHI per head figure may indicate a potential challenge in terms of affordability for care home services. Additionally, the positive house price growth percentage may pose a risk in terms of cost implications for establishing or maintaining care homes in the area. Overall, while there are strengths in quality standards and potential for improvement, investors should carefully consider the demographic trends and economic factors influencing the care home market in Preston.
