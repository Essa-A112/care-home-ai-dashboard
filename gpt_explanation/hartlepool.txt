Hartlepool, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 30.79, falls into the "Avoid" category. The district's high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 92.59% is a positive indicator. However, the presence of establishments requiring improvement at 7.41% and the lack of any "Outstanding" rated facilities raise concerns. The significant house price growth of 14.35% is a favorable aspect, potentially indicating economic stability. Despite this, the overall score suggests caution due to the existing issues with care quality. Thus, Hartlepool is deemed unsuitable for investment at present, as improvements in CQC ratings are necessary to enhance the overall investment potential in the care home sector.
