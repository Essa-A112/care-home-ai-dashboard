The Local Authority District of Hartlepool has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.45, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The high percentage of care homes requiring improvement and the limited number of homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission suggest potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is relatively low, indicating potential financial challenges for residents seeking care services. While the total population is a positive aspect, indicating a potential demand for care services, the lack of highly rated care homes and lower income levels present risks for investors. Given these factors, Hartlepool is currently not considered suitable for direct care home investment. Further improvements in care quality and income levels may make it a more viable investment option in the future.
