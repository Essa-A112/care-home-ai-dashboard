The West Suffolk Local Authority District has an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.00, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a certain level of quality in the existing care facilities. However, the percentage of homes requiring improvement is also notable, which suggests there may be room for enhancement in the overall care provision. The negative impact of house price growth is a concern, as it indicates potential economic challenges in the area that could affect investment viability. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of homes rated as "Outstanding" raises questions about the overall excellence of care services available. Given these factors, West Suffolk is deemed unsuitable for investment at present, as the score falls below the threshold considered suitable for investment. However, with improvements in areas such as CQC ratings and addressing economic factors like house price growth, the district could potentially become more attractive for investment in the future.
