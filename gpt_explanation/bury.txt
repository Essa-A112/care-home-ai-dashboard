The Local Authority District of Bury has an estimated care home investment potential score of 32.52, positioning it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Bury's relatively low percentage of CQC Good rated care homes at 85.19% and a notable portion requiring improvement at 7.41% contribute negatively to its overall score. Additionally, the total population of 195,476 and the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 18.46% further impact the investment potential. On a positive note, the significant house price growth of 17.91% presents a potential opportunity. However, given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised. Without significant improvements in the quality of existing care homes and considering the demographic factors, investing in care homes in Bury may not be advisable at this time.
