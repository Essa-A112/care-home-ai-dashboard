The Local Authority District of Bury has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.21, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area has seen significant house price growth, which could indicate a strong local economy. However, there are notable weaknesses that contribute to the lower score. The percentage of care homes requiring improvement, as well as the relatively low percentage of homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission, suggest potential quality issues within the care home sector in Bury. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is relatively low, which may impact the demand for care home services in the area. Overall, based on the current data, Bury is not considered suitable for investment in care homes. Further improvements in care home quality and an increase in the older population percentage could potentially change this assessment in the future.
