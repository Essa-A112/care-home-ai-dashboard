The Local Authority District of Bury has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 5.21, primarily driven by its robust house price growth rate of 18.54%. This positive indicator reflects a strong housing market that could support the development of care homes. However, the district faces challenges, as indicated by a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (7.41%) and a lower percentage of homes rated as good by the Care Quality Commission (85.19%). Additionally, with 18.46% of the population being 65 years old or older, there is a significant demand for elderly care services. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as outstanding (5.56%) also suggests room for improvement in the quality of care services provided. Despite these weaknesses, Bury presents an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the growing need for care facilities, given its strong housing market and potential for development in the care sector. However, mitigating the risks associated with the current state of care homes and addressing the needs of the aging population will be crucial for maximizing the investment potential in this district.
