The Local Authority District of Chesterfield has shown a promising care home investment potential with a score of 9.76, placing it in the "Consider" category. The positive factors contributing to this score include a significant House Price Growth of 16.34%, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 23.4%, and a sizeable population of 65 years and older at 22.19%. However, there are areas for improvement, such as a lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 at Â£18,333 and a modest percentage of CQC Outstanding at 6.38%. While Chesterfield may benefit from certain strengths like a growing housing market and a sizable elderly population, the lower income levels and fewer top-rated care facilities pose challenges. Considering the overall score falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability, further enhancements in income levels and care home quality could potentially elevate Chesterfield's attractiveness for investment in the future.
