The Local Authority District of Chesterfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 42.66, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Chesterfield benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, which is a positive factor. Additionally, the strong house price growth and a notable percentage of residents aged 65 and over contribute positively to its investment potential. However, the high proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC has a slight negative impact. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is comparatively lower, which is a potential weakness affecting the overall score.

Given its score falling within the "Consider" range, Chesterfield may be suitable for investment after further evaluation and potential improvements. The district shows promise with favorable indicators such as house price growth and a significant elderly population, suggesting a demand for care services. However, the lower GDHI per head indicates a potential financial constraint that investors should carefully consider. With targeted enhancements and strategic investments, Chesterfield has the potential to become a more attractive prospect for care home investment in the future.
