The Local Authority District of Portsmouth has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.49, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This rating is influenced by several key factors. Portsmouth exhibits a modest House Price Growth percentage, indicating a stable but not rapidly appreciating property market. The relatively high percentage of CQC Good rated care homes suggests a strong existing care infrastructure. However, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low, potentially limiting demand for care services. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 people is on the lower side, indicating potential saturation in the market. Considering these factors, Portsmouth may not offer significant growth potential for care home investments at present. It is advisable to explore other locations with higher investment potential scores for better opportunities.
