The investment potential score for Portsmouth, with a value of 34.82, places it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Portsmouth exhibits a negative house price growth rate of -10.1%, indicating a decline in property value which could impact investment returns. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' by the CQC at 25.71% is a positive aspect, suggesting a generally higher quality of care provision. On the other hand, the high proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' at 74.29% may indicate limited room for improvement in the quality of care services. Additionally, the lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 15.0% could potentially limit the demand for care home services in the area. With no care homes rated as 'Inadequate', there is a solid foundation for care provision. Overall, based on the current data, Portsmouth does not present a strong case for immediate investment due to the combination of declining property values and potentially limited growth opportunities in the care home sector.
