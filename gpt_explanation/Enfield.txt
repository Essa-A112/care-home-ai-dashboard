Enfield's estimated care home investment potential score of 4.08 is influenced by several key factors. The relatively low House_Price_Growth_% and Care_Homes_per_10k figures suggest a market where property values and care home availability may not be rapidly increasing, potentially indicating less competition for investment opportunities. However, the higher percentage of individuals aged 65 and older in the population could signal a growing demand for care services in the area. The strong showing in %_CQC_Good, with 77.78% of care homes meeting regulatory standards, highlights a positive quality aspect that could attract investors looking for well-performing assets. On the downside, the total population figure may indicate a need for additional care facilities to meet potential future demand. Overall, Enfield's score reflects a mix of strengths, such as quality care provision, and weaknesses, like potential population growth challenges, presenting both risks and advantages for prospective care home investors in the area.
