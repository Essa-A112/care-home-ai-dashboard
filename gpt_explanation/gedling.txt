The Local Authority District of Gedling has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.85, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment at present. This score is influenced by several key factors. Gedling shows strengths in its House Price Growth at 19.94%, indicating a positive trend in property values. However, the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (11.76%) and the low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (85.29%) are significant weaknesses. The population demographic, with 21.86% aged 65 and over, presents an opportunity for care home demand. Nevertheless, the absence of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' (0.0%) is a positive aspect. Given these factors, Gedling falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. Improvement in care home quality and addressing the issues identified could potentially shift its status to one that may be considered for investment in the future.
