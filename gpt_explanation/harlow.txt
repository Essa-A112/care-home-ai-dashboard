The Local Authority District of Harlow has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.10, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by a variety of factors. Harlow exhibits a negative impact on investment potential due to a decrease in house price growth and a lower proportion of individuals aged 65 and over. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 people in Harlow is relatively low, contributing to the overall lower score. On the positive side, the district shows a higher percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission and a lower percentage requiring improvement. However, despite these strengths, the overall score indicates that Harlow may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in house price growth, increasing the number of care homes, and addressing the aging population demographics could potentially enhance its investment attractiveness in the future.
