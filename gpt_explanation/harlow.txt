The Local Authority District of Harlow has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.41, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 28.57% is a strength. However, challenges lie in the modest house price growth of 4.46% and a lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 14.55%. Furthermore, while a majority of care homes in Harlow are rated as "Good" by the CQC, there is no room for complacency as any inadequate facilities could pose risks. Considering the score classification criteria, Harlow falls within the range that may be considered for investment after potential improvements. Despite its current standing, addressing the aging population percentage and enhancing house price growth could further boost its attractiveness for care home investments.
