The Local Authority District of Norwich has an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.44, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Norwich's relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 51.72% is a strength, indicating a good quality of care provision. However, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 34.48% is a potential area for enhancement. The lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 14.97% and modest house price growth of 3.36% also impact the score negatively. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is below average, which could affect the affordability of care services. Overall, while Norwich shows promise with its CQC ratings and steady house price growth, there are areas for improvement, particularly in addressing care home quality and catering to its aging population. Therefore, it falls within the range that may be considered for investment after improvements are made.
