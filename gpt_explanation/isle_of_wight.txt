The Isle of Wight LAD has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 6.59, driven by several key factors. The strong house price growth percentage indicates a thriving property market, suggesting potential for solid returns on investments in care homes. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is significant, indicating a potentially high demand for elderly care services. However, the relatively low percentages of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC and the small percentage requiring improvement raise concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. This could present a challenge for investors looking to enter the market and may require additional investment in upgrading or building new care homes to meet quality standards. Overall, while the Isle of Wight presents opportunities for investment due to favorable demographics and property market conditions, investors should be mindful of the quality of care facilities in the area as a potential risk factor.
