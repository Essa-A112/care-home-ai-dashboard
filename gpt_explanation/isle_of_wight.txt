The Isle of Wight's care home investment potential score of 33.89 places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential investors. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Requires Improvement," which may raise concerns about the quality of care provided. Conversely, the area shows strong house price growth, a positive indicator for potential returns on investment. However, the high proportion of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" suggests a competitive market with established providers. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services in the area. Considering these factors, the Isle of Wight may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at present, with potential risks outweighing advantages. Further improvements in care quality and market analysis could potentially shift its suitability for investment in the future.
