The Isle of Wight has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 6.59, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district benefits from a healthy house price growth rate of 16.46%, indicating a positive economic environment for investment. Additionally, with a population where nearly 30% are over 65, there is a clear demand for care services. However, challenges arise from a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC and a small portion requiring improvement. While the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is favorable, the overall quality of care facilities may need enhancement to attract investors. Given its current standing, the Isle of Wight could be considered for investment after addressing the quality of existing care homes to capitalize on the growing elderly population and property market.
