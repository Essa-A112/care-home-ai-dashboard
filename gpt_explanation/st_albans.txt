The investment potential score for St Albans, with a rating of 9.23, places it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mix of positive and negative factors influencing its attractiveness for care home investment. St Albans shows promising growth potential in terms of House Price Growth and Gross Disposable Household Income per capita, indicating a stable economic environment. However, challenges are evident, with a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement as per CQC assessments. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' and the proportion of the population aged 65 and over could pose risks in terms of meeting the needs of an aging demographic. While St Albans falls short of being immediately suitable for investment, its score suggests potential for improvement and future consideration with targeted interventions to address care quality and cater to the aging population.
