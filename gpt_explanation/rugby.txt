The Local Authority District of Rugby has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.79, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a strong house price growth percentage, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. However, the percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission is relatively high at 19.35%, suggesting a need for quality improvements in existing care facilities. Additionally, with 77.42% of care homes rated as "Good," there is room for enhancement to reach higher quality standards. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and above (18.0%) and the number of care homes per 10,000 residents further impact the score negatively. While Rugby shows promise with its growth potential, the need for improvement in care home quality and capacity suggests that further assessment and enhancements are necessary before considering significant investment.
