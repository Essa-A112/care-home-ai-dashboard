The Local Authority District of Rugby has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.23, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The positive house price growth of 17.64% indicates a potentially robust property market, which could attract investors. However, the relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 77.42% suggests room for improvement in the quality of care services. The presence of a significant elderly population at 18.0% highlights a potential demand for care facilities. While the district shows promise with positive house price growth and room for improvement in care quality, the lower percentage of "Good" rated care homes and a relatively small elderly population could pose challenges. Therefore, Rugby may be considered for investment after necessary improvements are made to enhance care quality and cater to the aging population.
