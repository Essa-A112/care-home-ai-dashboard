The Local Authority District of Harborough has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.37, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is predominantly influenced by several key factors. Harborough exhibits a negative impact on its investment potential due to a significant decrease in House Price Growth of -28.77%, which may deter potential investors. Despite this, the district boasts a relatively low percentage of CQC Inadequate ratings at 0.0%, which could be seen as a strength. However, the high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 76.47% might have contributed to the lower score, signaling potential saturation in the market. The presence of a positive impact from the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 22.29% suggests a potentially favorable demographic for care home services. Considering the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, it is recommended that caution be exercised when considering Harborough for care home investments. Further improvements in areas such as house price growth and diversification of CQC ratings may enhance its investment appeal in the future.
