The Local Authority District of Harborough has an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.11, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Despite a positive population demographic with 22.29% aged 65 and above, indicating potential demand for care services, the significant decrease in house price growth by -27.73% poses a notable risk. On the positive side, a high percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission at 76.47% suggests a relatively strong quality of care provision. However, the presence of 23.53% of care homes requiring improvement highlights areas for enhancement. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in Harborough at this time. Further improvements in house price growth and care home quality could potentially shift its investment potential in the future.
