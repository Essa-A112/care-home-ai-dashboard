The Local Authority District of Eastbourne has shown a strong investment potential score of 8.34, primarily due to its robust house price growth of 24.16%. This positive momentum indicates a healthy real estate market, making it an attractive location for investment. However, Eastbourne does face challenges with a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, standing at 7.35%. Despite this, the district boasts a high percentage of CQC-rated good care homes at 85.29%, reflecting a commitment to quality elderly care services. Additionally, with 24.71% of the population aged 65 and above, there is a clear demand for care facilities, further supported by a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents. Potential risks may include the need for improvements in some care homes, while advantages lie in the strong house price growth and a significant elderly population, presenting opportunities for investment in the care home sector in Eastbourne.
