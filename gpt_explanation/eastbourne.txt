The Local Authority District of Eastbourne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.97, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score indicates that while there are positive aspects supporting investment, there are also areas that require attention. Eastbourne benefits from a strong House Price Growth percentage of 44.96, indicating a potentially robust real estate market. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 7.35 suggests a generally good quality of care facilities. However, the high percentage of CQC Good at 85.29 may indicate saturation in the market. The aging population percentage of 24.71 and a moderate number of Care Homes per 10k residents also present opportunities for investment. Considering these factors, Eastbourne could be suitable for investment after further assessment and improvements to address the high number of existing good-rated care homes. It falls within the range where potential can be realized with strategic enhancements to existing facilities or the introduction of new care homes to cater to the aging population.
