The Local Authority District of Eastbourne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.34, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Eastbourne exhibits a strong house price growth rate of 24.16%, indicating a positive trend in the local property market. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (7.35%) and the dominance of CQC-rated "Good" care homes (85.29%) suggest areas for enhancement in the quality of care services. On a positive note, the district has a significant elderly population, with 24.71% aged 65 and above, which signifies a potential demand for care services. Moreover, Eastbourne boasts a relatively high density of care homes per 10,000 population, indicating an existing infrastructure to support the sector. While Eastbourne falls short of being classified as a top-tier investment opportunity, its promising house price growth and demographic profile suggest that with strategic improvements in care quality, it could become a more attractive investment destination in the future.
