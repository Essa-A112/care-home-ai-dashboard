The Local Authority District of Rotherham has shown a strong investment potential score of 9.42, driven by several key factors. The significant house price growth percentage indicates a thriving property market, making it an attractive location for investment. The high number of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests a demand for care services, potentially leading to stable returns for investors. However, Rotherham's relatively lower GDHI per head and population size could pose challenges in terms of disposable income and market size. The percentage of CQC outstanding ratings being on the lower side might signal areas for improvement in the quality of care facilities. Investors should consider these aspects when evaluating the risks and advantages of investing in care homes in Rotherham, balancing the potential for growth with the existing economic and demographic factors in the region.
