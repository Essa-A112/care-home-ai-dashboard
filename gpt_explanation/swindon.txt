Swindon, as a Local Authority District, has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.31, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the positive house price growth of 13.17% presents an advantage for potential investors, the high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 16.28% poses a challenge. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 8.93% and the significant proportion rated as "Good" at 76.79% indicate areas for improvement in the quality of care facilities. The presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 14.29% further underscores potential risks in the sector within Swindon. Given these factors, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering investment in care homes in this district. Further enhancements in care home quality and addressing the aging population demographic could potentially improve its investment potential in the future.
