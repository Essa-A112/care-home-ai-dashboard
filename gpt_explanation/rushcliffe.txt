Rushcliffe, a Local Authority District, has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.62, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is relatively high at 21.83%, indicating a potential demand for care services, other metrics present challenges. The district has a low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 81.4%, and a notable portion of homes requiring improvement at 11.63%. Additionally, the house price growth rate stands at 3.3%, potentially impacting affordability and investment returns. Given these factors, Rushcliffe may not be suitable for immediate investment due to existing weaknesses in care quality and housing market dynamics. However, with improvements in CQC ratings and housing affordability, this district could become more attractive for investment in the future.
