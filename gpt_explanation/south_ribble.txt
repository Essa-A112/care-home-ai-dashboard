The Local Authority District of South Ribble has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.19, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes is high at 89.74%, there is a notable proportion, 7.69%, that fall under the 'Requires Improvement' category. Additionally, the modest house price growth rate of 3.84% may indicate limited potential for property value appreciation. On a positive note, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over stands at 22.04%, suggesting a potential demand for care services. Moreover, with a total population of 113,552, there is a substantial market size. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Given the need for improvement in certain CQC ratings and the relatively low house price growth, South Ribble may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investment. Further assessment and potential enhancements in care quality and market conditions could make it a more viable option in the future.
