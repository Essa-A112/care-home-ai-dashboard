The Local Authority District of South Ribble has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.94, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively favorable at 22.04%, indicating potential demand for care services, South Ribble faces challenges in terms of care home quality. With a low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" facilities at 89.74% and no inadequate-rated homes, there is a significant need for improvement in care standards. Additionally, the presence of facilities requiring improvement at 7.69% raises concerns regarding the overall quality of care provision. The modest house price growth of 4.32% further dampens the investment outlook for the area. In summary, South Ribble's current profile suggests a need for substantial enhancements in care quality to make it a viable investment option in the future.
