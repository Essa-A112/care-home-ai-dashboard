South Ribble has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 2.19, influenced by various key factors. The district's high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 89.74% is a strength, indicating a strong existing care infrastructure. However, the presence of 7.69% of care homes requiring improvement suggests areas for enhancement. The relatively low house price growth rate may deter potential investors looking for quick returns. On the positive side, a notable advantage is the district's significant elderly population of 22.04%, highlighting a potential demand for care services. Additionally, with a total population of 113,552, there is a sizable market for care home services. Despite the strengths, potential risks lie in the need for improvement in some care homes and the sluggish house price growth, which could impact investment returns.
