The Local Authority District of Chorley has shown promising signs for care home investment with an estimated potential score of 9.47, placing it in the "Consider" category. Key positive factors contributing to this score include a strong house price growth of 14.75%, a significant percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 21.01%, and a low proportion of care homes rated as inadequate by the CQC at 2.94%. However, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively high at 2.85, which could pose a challenge for new investments. Despite this, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes rated as outstanding by the CQC at 2.94% indicates a level of quality within the existing care facilities. Overall, while Chorley shows potential for care home investment, further improvements in the care home density may be necessary to fully capitalize on its strengths.
