The Local Authority District of Chorley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 42.91, placing it within the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Chorley exhibits a positive House Price Growth of 16.61%, indicating a favorable market for property investment. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (20.59%) and inadequate ratings (2.94%) suggest a generally good standard of care within the district. The high proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 21.01% further highlights the potential demand for care services. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (73.53%) could indicate saturation in the market or potential competition. While Chorley falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its promising indicators suggest that with targeted improvements, it could become an attractive investment opportunity in the future.
