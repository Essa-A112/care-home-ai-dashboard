The investment potential score of 5.91 for Sevenoaks is likely influenced by a combination of factors. The relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 70.97% suggests a strong quality standard in the area, which can be appealing to investors seeking stable and reputable facilities. The significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 22.15% indicates a potentially robust demand for care services, supporting the viability of care home investments. However, the presence of 16.13% of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' could pose a risk, signaling areas where improvements may be needed to meet quality standards and attract residents. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth suggests potential challenges in property investment returns, although the relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 at Â£33,984 may offer a counterbalancing advantage by indicating a relatively affluent local population that could afford higher-end care services.
