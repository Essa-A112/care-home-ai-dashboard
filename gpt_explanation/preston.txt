The Local Authority District of Preston has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.84, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment at present. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district has a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which could indicate lower immediate care home demand, it also exhibits a significant proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission. However, the district's Gross Disposable Household Income per head and House Price Growth rate are below average, potentially impacting the financial viability of care home investments. Considering these factors, Preston may not be currently suitable for investment due to the lower income levels and house price growth, suggesting a potentially limited market for care home services in the area. Further improvements in economic indicators and demographic trends could make it a more favorable investment opportunity in the future.
