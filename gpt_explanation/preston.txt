The Local Authority District of Preston has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.08, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This classification is primarily influenced by a mix of positive and negative factors within the area. Notably, the relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of 'Requires Improvement' at 20.93% is a positive aspect. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC at 76.74% suggests a saturated market. Additionally, the moderate house price growth of 4.32% and the lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 14.58% may indicate a potentially limited demand for care home services. Although the absence of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' is a positive sign, the overall combination of factors places Preston below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. Further improvements in housing growth and demographic shifts could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
