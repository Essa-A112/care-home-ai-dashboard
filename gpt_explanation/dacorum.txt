The Local Authority District of Dacorum has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.89, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Dacorum demonstrates strengths in its low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and a relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head. However, challenges exist in the percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which may impact demand for care services. The modest house price growth rate also indicates a potential constraint on investment returns. Overall, while Dacorum shows promise with positive CQC ratings and economic indicators, its lower investment potential score suggests a need for further evaluation before committing to investment. Further improvements in demographics and market conditions could enhance its attractiveness for care home investment.
