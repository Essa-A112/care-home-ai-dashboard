The Local Authority District of Dacorum has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.51, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Dacorum performs well in terms of the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), with a positive impact on the score. However, there is a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement, which slightly detracts from its overall potential. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care home services in the area. On a positive note, the area's Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is relatively high, indicating potential affordability for care services. Despite these strengths and weaknesses, Dacorum falls below the threshold for direct investment suitability, suggesting that further improvements or considerations are necessary before committing to significant investments in care homes within this district.
