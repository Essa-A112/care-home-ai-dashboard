The East Riding of Yorkshire has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 10.92, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Positive indicators include a healthy house price growth rate of 9.44%, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 26.57%, a significant portion of the population aged 65 and over at 26.85%, and a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 64.34%. However, the total population figure of 350,119 has a negative impact on the overall score. While the East Riding of Yorkshire falls slightly below the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its favorable metrics suggest potential for growth with targeted improvements. Therefore, this LAD may be considered for investment after further assessment and enhancements to capitalize on its strengths and mitigate risks associated with population size.
