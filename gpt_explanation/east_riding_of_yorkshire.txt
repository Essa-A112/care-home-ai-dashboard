The East Riding of Yorkshire has shown promising indicators for care home investment with an estimated potential score of 45.36, positioning it in the "Consider" category. Positive aspects include a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC standards, a healthy house price growth rate, and a significant portion of the population aged 65 and over. Moreover, a notable percentage of care homes in the district have been rated as "Good" by the CQC, reflecting a higher quality of care provision. However, the presence of a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" serves as a potential area for improvement. While the overall score falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, the district's strengths suggest that with targeted enhancements in certain areas, it could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
