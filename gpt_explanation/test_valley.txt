The Local Authority District of Test Valley has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 8.06, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a strong house price growth rate of 10.88%, indicating a healthy economic environment for investment. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is 21.71%, suggesting a potentially high demand for care services. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is at Â£26,074, further indicating the financial capacity of the local population to afford care services. However, Test Valley does face challenges, such as a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 6.67%, and a notable percentage requiring improvement at 20.0%. These factors may pose risks in terms of service quality and regulatory compliance. Overall, Test Valley falls into a category where investment can be considered after improvements, as it shows promise but also areas that need enhancement to fully capitalize on its potential.
