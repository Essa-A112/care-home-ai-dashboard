The Local Authority District of Test Valley has shown promising investment potential in the care home sector with an estimated score of 8.06. This is largely influenced by several key factors. The district's strong house price growth of 10.88% indicates a healthy real estate market, which can be advantageous for property investments. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 21.71% suggests a potentially robust demand for care services in the area. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is also at a respectable level of 26,074, indicating a financially stable population that may be able to afford quality care services. However, there are some challenges to consider, such as the lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 6.67% and a higher percentage requiring improvement at 20.0%. This highlights the need for potential investors to focus on improving the quality of care facilities in the district to meet the growing demand from an aging population. Overall, while Test Valley shows promise for care home investments, careful attention to quality and service improvement will be crucial for long-term success in this market.
