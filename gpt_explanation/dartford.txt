The Local Authority District of Dartford has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 9.79, driven by several key factors. Despite a slight negative impact from House Price Growth, Dartford stands out with a relatively balanced distribution of CQC ratings, with a significant portion of care homes rated as Good and only a small percentage rated as Inadequate. This indicates a relatively stable and well-regulated care home sector within the district. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is lower compared to some other areas, which could suggest a potentially growing market for care home services as the population ages. However, the negative impact of House Price Growth may pose a challenge for investment returns, as property values in the area have experienced a decline. Overall, Dartford presents a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, albeit with some risks associated with the housing market dynamics.
