The Local Authority District of South Hams has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 49.27, categorizing it as a good option for investment. This score is influenced positively by several key factors, including a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings at 29.41%, a healthy house price growth rate of 13.87%, and a significant portion of the population aged 65 and over at 28.75%. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC at 70.59% is a potential weakness affecting the score, as it indicates a competitive market with established providers. Despite this, the absence of any care homes rated as 'Outstanding' presents an opportunity for new investments to excel in quality. Overall, South Hams appears to be a suitable location for care home investment due to its overall positive indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for potential growth and success in the sector.
