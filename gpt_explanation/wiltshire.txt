The Local Authority District of Wiltshire has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 6.58, driven by several key factors. The relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 22.64% suggests a potentially strong demand for care homes in the area. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 78.38% indicates a good quality of care services available. Moreover, with a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents and a low percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' at 20.0%, Wiltshire presents a favorable environment for potential care home investments. However, the negative impact of house price growth may pose a challenge, as it could affect affordability for both investors and potential residents. It is essential for investors to carefully consider this aspect alongside the district's strengths to mitigate risks and maximize the advantages of investing in care homes in Wiltshire.
