The investment potential score for Wiltshire, a Local Authority District, is 38.33, placing it in the "Consider" category. Wiltshire exhibits a mix of positive and negative factors influencing its score. It boasts a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission at 20.0%, indicating a decent quality of care provision. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is moderate at 22.64%, suggesting a potentially stable demand for care services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 78.38% and a modest house price growth of 5.28% may pose challenges for investment returns. Notably, the absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" is a positive indicator. While Wiltshire falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, it may be worth considering for investment after implementing enhancements to overcome its current limitations and capitalize on its strengths.
