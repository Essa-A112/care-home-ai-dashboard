The Local Authority District of Wiltshire has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 6.58, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Wiltshire exhibits a slight positive impact in terms of its percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potential demand for care services. Moreover, with a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), there is a strong quality assurance aspect in the region. However, the negative impact of house price growth suggests potential challenges in affordability for both care home operators and residents. Despite this, the district's relatively low proportion of care homes requiring improvement and a decent number of care homes per 10,000 residents indicate a decent infrastructure for the sector. While Wiltshire falls short of being an ideal investment location, it may still be considered for investment with strategic improvements to address affordability concerns and further enhance care quality standards.
