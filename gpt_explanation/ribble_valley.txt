The Ribble Valley Local Authority District has demonstrated a strong investment potential score of 8.40, primarily driven by its robust House Price Growth percentage, indicating a healthy and growing property market. The relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above suggests a potentially increasing demand for care homes, aligning with the positive SHAP impact on investment potential. However, the lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) may pose a challenge, as it indicates room for improvement in the quality of care services provided. The GDHI per head value further supports the positive investment outlook, indicating a relatively affluent population likely willing to invest in quality care facilities. Despite the strengths, the need for enhancements in CQC ratings could be a notable risk factor that investors should consider when evaluating opportunities in the care home sector within Ribble Valley.
