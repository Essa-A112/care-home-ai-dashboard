The Ribble Valley Local Authority District has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 8.40, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Positive aspects include a strong house price growth rate of 13.70%, a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 24.98%, and a healthy Gross Disposable Household Income per capita. However, the presence of 14.29% of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings is a notable weakness. While the area showcases potential for growth and a significant elderly population, the need for enhancements in CQC ratings suggests room for improvement. Therefore, with further development in care home quality, Ribble Valley could be a viable investment opportunity in the future, making it worth considering for investment after improvements.
