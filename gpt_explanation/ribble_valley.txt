The Ribble Valley Local Authority District has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.96, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed profile of features. On the positive side, the area demonstrates a healthy House Price Growth of 17.21%, indicating a potentially buoyant property market. Additionally, with 24.98% of the population aged 65 and over, there is a clear demand for elderly care services. However, the presence of 14.29% of care homes requiring improvement and only 85.71% rated as good by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggests some quality concerns within the existing care facilities. While the absence of inadequate-rated homes is a positive sign, the need for improvement in a significant portion of care homes could pose challenges. Overall, with a score just below the investment threshold, Ribble Valley may be considered for investment after addressing the quality issues to capitalize on its growth potential and demographic trends.
