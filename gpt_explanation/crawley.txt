The Local Authority District of Crawley has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -6.91, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key negative factors. Crawley exhibits a significant decline in House Price Growth, indicating potential economic instability. Moreover, a high percentage of care homes in the area have been rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission, suggesting challenges in delivering high-quality care services. The relatively low proportion of residents aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care home services. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is below average, potentially impacting the affordability of care services in the area. Given these factors, Crawley is not currently deemed suitable for care home investment. Significant improvements in economic conditions, care quality ratings, and demographic trends would be necessary to reconsider investment opportunities in this area.
