The Local Authority District of Crawley has been assessed to have an estimated care home investment potential score of 15.11, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This classification is primarily influenced by several key factors. Crawley exhibits a notable decline in House Price Growth, indicating potential economic challenges. Additionally, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement, alongside a lower percentage of those rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, suggests quality concerns within the existing care facilities. Furthermore, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, coupled with a below-average number of care homes per 10,000 individuals, may indicate a limited demand for care services in the area. Given these factors, Crawley's current state does not present an attractive opportunity for care home investment. It may be prudent to explore other regions with more favorable indicators for potential returns and success in the care home industry.
