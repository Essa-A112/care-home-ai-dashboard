St. Helens has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 8.08, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed picture of strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the district exhibits robust house price growth, indicating a healthy economic environment for investments. Additionally, a small percentage of care homes achieving an outstanding rating suggests a commitment to quality care provision. However, challenges lie in the relatively high proportion of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). This highlights areas needing enhancement in care standards. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is on the lower end, potentially impacting the affordability of care services. Overall, St. Helens presents an opportunity for investment with room for improvement in care quality standards to maximize returns.
