St. Helens has shown a strong potential for care home investments with an estimated score of 8.08, primarily due to its robust house price growth which indicates a promising real estate market for care home development. However, the district faces challenges with a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC ratings. The notable strengths lie in a small percentage of outstanding CQC-rated care homes, suggesting a presence of high-quality care facilities. On the flip side, the GDHI per head for 2022 is lower, indicating potential affordability issues for residents seeking care services. Investors should consider the need for improvements in existing care homes and the economic conditions of the local population as potential risks. Nonetheless, the district's growth potential and the presence of top-rated care homes offer opportunities for strategic investments in the care home sector.
