The investment potential score of 5.98 for Redcar and Cleveland suggests a moderately favorable outlook for care home investments in the area. The district's above-average House Price Growth percentage indicates a promising trend for property value appreciation, which could benefit care home investors. However, the relatively high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings and a lower proportion of CQC Good ratings may pose challenges in terms of ensuring high-quality care services. The aging population, with 23.83% aged 65 and over, presents an opportunity for care home demand to potentially grow. On the downside, the GDP Head Income for 2022 at 17686 reflects a comparatively lower economic prosperity level, which could impact the affordability of care services for residents. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the potential risks and advantages of investing in care homes in Redcar and Cleveland.
