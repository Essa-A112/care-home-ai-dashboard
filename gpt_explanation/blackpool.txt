The Local Authority District of Blackpool has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.28, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score suggests that while there are aspects that indicate potential for investment, there are also areas that require improvement. Blackpool shows strengths in its CQC ratings, with a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" and a notable percentage rated as "Outstanding." However, challenges arise from factors such as lower house price growth, below-average GDHI per head, and a significant portion of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments. These factors indicate a mixed landscape for care home investment in Blackpool. While it may be considered for investment after targeted improvements, caution is advised due to the existing challenges. Further analysis and strategic planning would be necessary to capitalize on the district's strengths and address its weaknesses effectively.
