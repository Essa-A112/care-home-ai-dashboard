The Local Authority District of North Norfolk has a notable estimated care home investment potential score of 16.38, driven by several key features. The positive House_Price_Growth_% indicates a growing housing market, which can stimulate demand for care homes. Additionally, the high percentages of care homes with a CQC rating of Good and the relatively low % CQC RequiresImprovement suggest a strong quality of care within the area, appealing to potential investors. The significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and above further underlines the potential demand for care services. However, despite these strengths, the relatively low Care_Homes_per_10k metric suggests a potential undersupply of care home facilities, presenting an opportunity for investment but also posing a risk in meeting future demand. Investors should consider leveraging the district's positive aspects while addressing the need for increased care home availability to capitalize on the growing market.
