The investment potential score of 0.29 for Newcastle upon Tyne reflects a mixed outlook for care home investments in the area. Despite the negative impact of factors such as a decrease in house price growth and a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over, there are some strengths to consider. The relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (73.08%) suggests a higher quality of care provision in the region, which could be attractive to investors. However, the presence of a significant percentage of care homes requiring improvement (19.23%) and a lower GDHI per head in 2022 could pose risks in terms of profitability and demand for care services. Investors in Newcastle upon Tyne would need to carefully weigh these factors to make informed decisions regarding care home investments in the area.
