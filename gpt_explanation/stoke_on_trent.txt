The Local Authority District of Stoke-on-Trent has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.79, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, a relatively high percentage of care homes in the area are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good standard of care. However, there are challenges to consider, such as a significant proportion of homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services. The modest growth in house prices and the lower Gross Disposable Household Income per capita further suggest potential financial constraints for investment in care homes in this area. Given these factors, Stoke-on-Trent may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present, but improvements in CQC ratings and demographic trends could make it a more viable option in the future.
