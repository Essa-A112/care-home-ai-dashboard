The Local Authority District of Stoke-on-Trent has an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.43, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows strengths in its relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, standing at 25.3%. However, challenges arise from a lower house price growth rate of 3.84% and a smaller proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 17.3%. Additionally, while a significant percentage of care homes are rated as "Good" by the CQC at 72.29%, there is no room for complacency as there are no care homes rated as "Inadequate." Given these considerations, Stoke-on-Trent may be suitable for investment after careful assessment and potential improvements to address the areas of concern. It falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment, indicating that targeted enhancements could enhance its attractiveness for care home investments.
