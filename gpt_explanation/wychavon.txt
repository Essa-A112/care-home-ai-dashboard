The Local Authority District of Wychavon has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.26, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This rating is influenced by several key factors. Wychavon exhibits a relatively high House Price Growth percentage, indicating a positive trend in the housing market. However, the percentages of CQC Requires Improvement and CQC Good ratings are less favorable, suggesting potential quality issues within care homes in the area. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is moderately high, which could signify a demand for care services. The GDHI per head value also indicates a decent economic standing. Despite these mixed indicators, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Therefore, Wychavon is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to the need for improvements in care quality and overall investment potential.
