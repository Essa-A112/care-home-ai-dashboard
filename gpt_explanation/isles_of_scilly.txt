The Local Authority District of Isles of Scilly has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 36.72, driven by several key factors. The district's strong house price growth percentage indicates a stable and potentially lucrative property market, which is a positive indicator for investment in care homes. Additionally, the fact that 100% of care homes in the area require improvement according to the Care Quality Commission suggests a significant opportunity for investors to make improvements and enhance the quality of care provided. With a total population of 2229 and a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 27.14%, there is a clear demand for care services in the area. However, the lack of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC may pose a challenge in terms of initial investment and operational improvements needed to meet regulatory standards. Investors should carefully consider the potential risks and advantages associated with investing in care homes in Isles of Scilly, weighing the opportunity for growth against the need for significant improvements to meet quality standards.
