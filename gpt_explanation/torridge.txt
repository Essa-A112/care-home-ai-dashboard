The Local Authority District of Torridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.36, placing it in the "Avoid" category. The key features influencing this score include a relatively low percentage of care homes with a "Good" rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 90.91%, which has a negative impact. Additionally, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is 9.09%, also negatively affecting the score. On the positive side, Torridge exhibits a notable house price growth rate of 14.93% and a significant proportion of residents over the age of 65 at 29.34%. Moreover, the district has a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 4.79. However, despite these strengths, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Torridge may require improvements in CQC ratings and other factors to become a more attractive investment opportunity in the care home sector.
