The Local Authority District of Barnsley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 42.24, positioning it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Barnsley exhibits a healthy House Price Growth percentage of 16.76%, indicating a positive trend in the local housing market. Moreover, the relatively low percentages of CQC Inadequate (4.65%) and CQC Requires Improvement (18.6%) reflect a decent quality of care in the area. However, the high percentage of CQC Good (73.26%) suggests a saturated market with strong competition. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is on the lower side at Â£18,427, potentially impacting the affordability of care services. While Barnsley shows promise with its positive indicators, the challenges posed by market saturation and lower income levels warrant caution. Therefore, this LAD falls into the "Consider" category, indicating that while it may offer investment opportunities, careful evaluation and potential improvements are advisable before making significant investments in the care home sector in Barnsley.
