Southend-on-Sea has a moderate care home investment potential score of 5.79, driven by a combination of factors. The high percentage of care homes with a 'Good' CQC rating at 82.11% is a strength, indicating a good standard of care in the area. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 15.79% poses a weakness that could impact the overall quality of care available. The presence of 5.21 care homes per 10,000 population is a positive indicator of the accessibility of care services in the area. The notable house price growth of 8.45% suggests a potentially lucrative investment opportunity, but it also raises concerns about affordability for residents. The low percentage of care homes rated 'Outstanding' at 2.11% indicates room for improvement in delivering exceptional care services. Overall, Southend-on-Sea presents a balanced investment opportunity with strengths in care quality and accessibility, but risks related to quality consistency and affordability.
