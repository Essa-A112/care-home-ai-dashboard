The Local Authority District of Welwyn Hatfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.50, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 21.88% is a strength. However, weaknesses such as a slight decline in house price growth at -0.04% and a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC at 78.12% contribute negatively to the score. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low at 16.07%, which could impact the demand for care homes in the area. Given these factors, Welwyn Hatfield is currently deemed unsuitable for investment. However, with potential improvements in house price growth and a higher proportion of the elderly population, this district could be reconsidered for investment in the future.
