The investment potential score of 9.76 for Chesterfield indicates a promising opportunity in the care home sector. The district's strong house price growth, coupled with a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), suggests a favorable environment for investment. Additionally, with over 22% of the population aged 65 or older, there is a significant potential market for care home services. However, challenges may arise from the lower Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head compared to other areas, which could impact the affordability of care services for residents. Moreover, the relatively lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' by the CQC may indicate room for improvement in the quality of care facilities. Despite these factors, the overall positive indicators in terms of demand and regulatory standards make Chesterfield an attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on the growing need for care services in an aging population.
