The investment potential score for East Cambridgeshire, with a value of 30.06, places it in the 'Avoid' category for care home investment. This rating is primarily influenced by the distribution of Care Quality Commission (CQC) ratings within the district. While the percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' is relatively high at 81.82%, the presence of homes requiring improvement (9.09%) and those rated as 'Outstanding' (9.09%) suggests a mixed quality landscape. Additionally, the lack of any care homes rated as 'Inadequate' is a positive sign. A key positive aspect is the healthy house price growth of 6.25%, which could indicate a growing local economy. However, the overall CQC distribution and the investment score below the threshold for consideration indicate that East Cambridgeshire may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investment. Further improvements in CQC ratings and a more consistent quality profile could make it a viable option in the future.
