The Local Authority District of East Cambridgeshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.47, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 21.11%, indicating a potential demand for care services, other metrics such as the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents and the high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement or with outstanding issues by the Care Quality Commission are concerning. The predominance of care homes with ratings below "Good" suggests a need for significant improvements in the existing care facilities. Given these factors, East Cambridgeshire is currently not deemed suitable for investment in the care home sector. Further investment and improvements in care quality would be necessary to reconsider its potential for investment in the future.
