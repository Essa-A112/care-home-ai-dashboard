The Local Authority District of Sandwell has an estimated care home investment potential score of 43.59, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (28.41%) and the healthy house price growth rate of 17.45% indicate a promising environment for investment. However, challenges exist in the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC (71.59%), which may suggest a competitive market. Additionally, a lower proportion of the population being 65 years old and above (14.65%) and a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 (15305) could potentially impact the demand for care home services. Overall, while Sandwell shows potential for investment with room for improvement, it falls slightly below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. Further enhancements in quality ratings and demographic factors could position Sandwell more favorably for investment in the future.
