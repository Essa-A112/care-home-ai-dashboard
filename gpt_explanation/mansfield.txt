The Local Authority District of Mansfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 29.12, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Mansfield shows a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" or "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), with a high proportion falling into the "Requires Improvement" category. While the positive house price growth may indicate some economic stability, the overall CQC ratings suggest potential challenges in the quality of care provided in the area. With a score below the threshold for investment suitability, Mansfield may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Improvement efforts in care home quality and regulatory compliance could potentially shift its suitability for investment in the future.
