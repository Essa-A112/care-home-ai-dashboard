The Local Authority District of Merton has been evaluated with an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.50, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key features. Merton exhibits a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 93.62%, coupled with a notable proportion of facilities requiring improvement at 4.26%. The modest house price growth rate of 2.89% and a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 13.09% further contribute to the overall score. However, the district's Gross Disposable Household Income per capita in 2022 is a positive factor at Â£33,360. Based on the classification criteria, Merton does not currently appear suitable for direct care home investment. The combination of lower CQC ratings, limited demographic demand, and subdued property market growth suggest that further improvements may be necessary before considering investment in this area.
