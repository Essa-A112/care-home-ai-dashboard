Merton has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 27.90, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. Several key factors contribute to this evaluation. The district exhibits a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 93.62%, suggesting room for improvement in the quality of care services. Additionally, a notable proportion of the population is aged 65 and over at 13.09%, indicating potentially higher demand for care services in the future. However, the low percentage of CQC-rated care homes requiring improvement at 4.26% is a positive aspect. The district's house price growth percentage of 10.43% could indicate a stable and potentially lucrative property market. Despite these strengths, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Further assessment and potential improvements may be necessary before considering investment in care homes within the Merton area.
