The Local Authority District of Merton has received a care home investment potential score of 0.50, indicating moderate potential in this sector. Merton's high percentage of CQC 'Good' rated care homes at 93.62% is a significant strength, reflecting a strong quality of care provision in the area. However, the relatively low House Price Growth and a smaller percentage of the population aged 65 and over may present challenges for investment attractiveness. The positive impact of a relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 suggests potential for higher spending on care services by residents. One notable risk could be the lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement,' which might indicate a lack of room for improvement and innovation in the market. Overall, Merton's solid care home quality standards and favorable GDHI per head are key factors contributing to its moderate investment potential score.
