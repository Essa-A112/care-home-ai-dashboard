The Local Authority District of Ashford has a relatively lower estimated care home investment potential score of -1.78, primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative House_Price_Growth_% indicates a declining trend in property values, which could impact the financial viability of care home investments. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as CQC Requires Improvement and the relatively lower percentage rated as CQC Good suggest potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and over being relatively low may indicate a smaller target market for care home services. On a positive note, the presence of care homes rated as CQC Outstanding showcases some quality providers within the area. However, the overall profile suggests challenges in terms of property value trends, care home quality, and potentially limited demand due to a lower proportion of older residents, highlighting the need for careful consideration and risk assessment before investing in care homes in Ashford.
