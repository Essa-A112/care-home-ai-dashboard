The Local Authority District of Lewisham has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.38, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is predominantly influenced by several key factors. Lewisham exhibits a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong quality of care provision. However, this positive aspect is counteracted by a low house price growth rate, a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement, a relatively small percentage of residents aged 65 and over, and a large total population size. These factors collectively suggest a challenging environment for care home investment in Lewisham. Given its overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised when considering care home investments in this area. Further improvements in several areas may enhance its investment potential in the future.
