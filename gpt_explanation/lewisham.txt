The Local Authority District of Lewisham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 26.55, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While Lewisham has a notable percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC, the presence of a significant portion of homes requiring improvement, coupled with a relatively low percentage of outstanding facilities, contributes to the lower score. Additionally, the negative house price growth and a relatively low proportion of the population aged 65 and over further impact its investment potential. Considering these factors, investing in care homes in Lewisham may not be advisable at present due to the existing challenges and risks. However, with improvements in CQC ratings and demographic shifts, there may be potential for reconsideration in the future.
