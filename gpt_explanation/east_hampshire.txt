The Local Authority District of East Hampshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.93, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced positively by a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above, as well as a significant number of care homes per 10,000 people in the area. However, challenges are present, with a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Additionally, the rate of house price growth is slightly negative, which may impact the overall investment attractiveness. While there are strengths in the demographics and care home availability, the need for improvements in care home quality and the slightly negative house price growth suggest that further assessment and potential enhancements are necessary before considering significant investments in care homes in East Hampshire.
