The Local Authority District of East Hampshire has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.58, categorizing it as falling into the "Avoid" classification. This score is primarily influenced by key factors within the district. Positive aspects include a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated inadequate care homes, standing at 0.0%, and a significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 24.14%. Moreover, the growth in house prices at 5.02% and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 4.44 indicate potential opportunities for investment. However, a notable weakness is the percentage of care homes requiring improvement, which stands at 16.07%. This factor likely contributed to the overall lower investment potential score. Considering the current assessment, East Hampshire is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to its score falling below the recommended threshold. However, with improvements in the quality of care homes, there may be potential for reconsideration in the future.
