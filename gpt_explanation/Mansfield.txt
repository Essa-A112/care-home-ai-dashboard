The investment potential score of 2.99 for Mansfield suggests a moderate outlook for care home investments in this Local Authority District. Several key features contribute to this score. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' or 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) indicates areas for improvement in the quality of care facilities. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement is a potential weakness that could impact the attractiveness of investing in the sector. On a positive note, the strong house price growth in the area signifies a potentially robust local economy, which could benefit care home investments in the long term. However, the relatively low GDHI per head figure may pose a risk, as it could indicate lower disposable income levels among residents. Overall, while Mansfield shows some promising signs with its housing market, addressing the quality of care homes and economic indicators could further enhance its investment potential in the care home sector.
