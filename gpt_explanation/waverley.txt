The Local Authority District of Waverley has received a relatively high care home investment potential score of 7.91, primarily due to several key factors. One strength contributing to this score is the high percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a favorable quality of care provision. Additionally, the relatively low House Price Growth percentage suggests potential affordability for investors looking to establish care home facilities in the area. The significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over, combined with a relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income per capita and a notable density of care homes per 10,000 people, further enhance the attractiveness of Waverley for care home investments. However, a potential weakness could be the challenge of maintaining high standards of care amidst an aging population and the need to ensure sufficient demand to fill the existing care home capacity. Additionally, fluctuations in house prices could impact the financial viability of care home investments in the long term. Overall, Waverley presents a promising opportunity for care home investments, but careful consideration of demographics and market dynamics is crucial to mitigate risks and maximize returns.
