The Local Authority District of Waverley has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 40.33, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key features contribute to this score: a notable 9.03% house price growth indicates a positive economic environment, while a relatively low percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 19.23% suggests a good quality of care provision. Additionally, the significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 22.13% indicates a potential demand for care services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' at 75.0% may pose a challenge for new investments to stand out in a competitive market. Nonetheless, the absence of inadequate-rated care homes at 0.0% mitigates some risks associated with poor quality services. Overall, Waverley falls within the range where investment may be considered after further improvements to address existing competition. With strategic enhancements to differentiate care offerings, this district could become a lucrative investment opportunity in the future.
