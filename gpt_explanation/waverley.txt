The Local Authority District of Waverley has shown promise in its care home investment potential with a score of 7.91, falling within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by factors such as a solid percentage (75.0%) of Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated 'Good' care homes, a significant proportion (22.13%) of the population aged 65 and over, and a relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head of 36306. However, the modest house price growth of 3.41% could be a limiting factor. With 4.01 care homes per 10,000 residents, there is a good infrastructure in place. Overall, Waverley shows potential for care home investment, especially if improvements are made to boost house price growth. While not yet ideal for immediate investment, with enhancements, it could become a more attractive prospect in the future.
