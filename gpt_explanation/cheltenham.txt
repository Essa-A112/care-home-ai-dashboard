Cheltenham, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 30.07, falls into the 'Avoid' category for investment. This classification is primarily influenced by several key factors. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 8.57% and a notable portion requiring improvement at 14.29% suggest room for enhancement in care quality within the district. Additionally, the negative house price growth rate of -4.72% may indicate a potential economic downturn affecting property values. While the absence of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' is a positive aspect, the dominant percentage of 'Good' rated homes at 77.14% highlights a need for further exceptional care provision. Given these factors, investing in Cheltenham's care home sector may not be advisable at present due to the current overall investment potential score falling below the recommended threshold.
