Cheltenham, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.52, falls into the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. The negative impact of house price growth, the relatively high percentage of CQC requiring improvement, and the lower proportion of the population aged 65 and above all contribute to the lower investment potential. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" is a positive aspect. Despite this, the overall score indicates that Cheltenham may not be a favorable location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in house price growth, CQC ratings, and an increase in the elderly population could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
