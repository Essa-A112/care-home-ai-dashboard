The investment potential score of 10.92 for the East Riding of Yorkshire Local Authority District indicates a strong outlook for care home investments. This is primarily driven by several key factors. The positive house price growth percentage suggests a healthy property market, making it an attractive location for real estate investments. The relatively high percentage of the population aged 65 and above is a significant strength, indicating a potentially high demand for care services. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC inspections requiring improvement and the high percentage of CQC-rated good care homes reflect a favorable regulatory environment and quality of care facilities. However, the total population figure may pose a challenge as it suggests a smaller overall market size compared to more densely populated areas. Despite this, the combination of positive indicators indicates a promising landscape for care home investments in the East Riding of Yorkshire, albeit with the potential risk of limited market size compared to larger urban areas.
