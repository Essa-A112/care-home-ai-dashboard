The Local Authority District of Wokingham received a care home investment potential score of 3.95, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for investment in the care home sector. The positive factors contributing to this score include a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 72.34%, suggesting a strong quality of care provision in the area. However, the presence of 14.89% of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC is a potential concern, highlighting areas where enhancements may be needed. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of population aged 65 and over at 17.37% may pose a challenge in terms of the demand for care home services. The moderate house price growth rate of 1.41% could indicate stable property market conditions, offering potential stability for investment returns. Overall, while Wokingham has strengths in care quality and property market stability, addressing areas for improvement and adapting to demographic trends will be crucial for maximizing the care home investment potential in this district.
