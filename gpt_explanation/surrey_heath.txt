Surrey Heath, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 26.59, falls into the "Avoid" category. This rating is primarily influenced by several factors. The district showcases a high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" at 94.74%, which might seem positive. However, the presence of 5.26% of care homes requiring improvement and a significant negative house price growth of -4.29% indicate potential challenges. On the brighter side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is at 20.37%, suggesting a demand for care services. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively high at 4.12, indicating a competitive market. Overall, due to the lower investment potential score and the need for improvement in certain care homes, Surrey Heath is currently deemed unsuitable for investment. Further evaluation and enhancements in quality ratings and market conditions could potentially shift its status in the future.
