The Local Authority District of Surrey Heath has an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.05, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative house price growth percentage, coupled with a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, contributes to the lower investment potential. However, the district does have a high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 population, which are positive indicators. With a total population of 92,168, Surrey Heath shows potential for care home demand. Despite these strengths, the overall score suggests that investment in this district may not be advisable at present. Further improvements in house price growth and CQC ratings could potentially shift its investment potential in the future.
