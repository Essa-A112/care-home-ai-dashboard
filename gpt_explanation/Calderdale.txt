The Local Authority District of Calderdale has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.50, which indicates a moderate level of attractiveness for investment. The positive House Price Growth percentage suggests a promising environment for property appreciation, potentially yielding good returns for investors. However, the relatively lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the higher proportion requiring improvement could pose challenges in ensuring high-quality care services. Additionally, the significant percentage of residents aged 65 and over, along with a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head, may indicate a higher demand for care services but potentially limited financial capacity among the population. Investors should carefully consider these factors, as they present both risks and opportunities in the care home investment landscape in Calderdale.
