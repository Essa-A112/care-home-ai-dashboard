The Local Authority District of Horsham has a moderate care home investment potential score of 4.48, influenced by several key features. Horsham benefits from a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for elderly care services. Moreover, the district boasts a high proportion of care facilities with a 'Good' rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), reflecting positively on the quality of care provided in the area. However, Horsham faces challenges such as a small percentage of care facilities requiring improvement according to the CQC, suggesting areas for potential enhancement. Additionally, the sluggish growth in house prices might pose a constraint on the affordability of care homes in the region. Despite these weaknesses, Horsham's residents exhibit a decent level of Gross Disposable Household Income per capita, indicating a certain level of financial stability that could support investment in care homes. Overall, while Horsham has strengths in terms of demographics and care quality, mitigating factors like house price growth and areas needing improvement should be considered when evaluating its investment potential in the care home sector.
