The Local Authority District of Luton has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 47.38, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 56.1%, alongside a low percentage of homes requiring improvement. However, the lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 11.64% is a factor that has a negative impact on the score. On the positive side, the significant house price growth of 9.57% adds to the investment appeal of Luton. With no care homes rated as "Inadequate," Luton presents a solid foundation for investment, although the need for improvement in certain areas suggests that further enhancements could potentially elevate its investment attractiveness. Overall, Luton falls within the range for consideration after improvements, indicating the potential for growth and development in the care home sector in this district.
