South Staffordshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.40, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 25.63%, indicating a potential demand for care services, the low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC at 3.45% and a high percentage requiring improvement at 93.1% raise concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, the modest house price growth of 4.74% suggests limited potential for property appreciation. With a total population of 113,088, there is a decent-sized market, but the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Therefore, South Staffordshire may not be the best choice for care home investment at present due to the need for significant improvements in care home quality and market conditions.
