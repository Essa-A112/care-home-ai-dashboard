Stockton-on-Tees, with an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.14, falls into the avoid category due to several key factors. The negative impact on the score is primarily driven by a decrease in house price growth, a higher percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, a lower proportion of care homes rated as good, a relatively lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over, and a modest Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022. These factors collectively suggest potential challenges in the care home investment landscape in Stockton-on-Tees. While the district has strengths such as a good percentage of care homes rated as good and a relatively lower percentage of elderly population, the overall score indicates that it may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in the identified areas could potentially make Stockton-on-Tees more attractive for investment in the future.
