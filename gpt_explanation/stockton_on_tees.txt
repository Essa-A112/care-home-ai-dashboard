Stockton-on-Tees has an estimated care home investment potential score of 26.16, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 87.5% indicates room for improvement in the quality of care provided. Additionally, a notable negative impact comes from the percentage of homes requiring improvement, standing at 7.81%. The negative house price growth and Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head further contribute to the lower investment potential score. These factors collectively suggest that Stockton-on-Tees may not be the most favorable location for care home investments at present. Given the score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised in considering this area for care home investment until improvements are made in the aforementioned aspects.
