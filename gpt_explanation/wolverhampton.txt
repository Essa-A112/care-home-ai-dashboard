The Local Authority District of Wolverhampton has shown promising care home investment potential with a score of 13.48, categorizing it as a good investment opportunity. This is primarily due to key features such as a strong house price growth of 23.24%, a high percentage of CQC rated Good care homes at 63.01%, and a significant proportion of homes requiring improvement at 35.62%. However, challenges exist with a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 16.41% and a modest GDHI per head of Â£16,987 in 2022. Despite these weaknesses, the overall positive impact of house price growth and CQC ratings outweighs the negatives, making Wolverhampton a suitable location for care home investment. The potential for improvement in CQC ratings also presents an opportunity for enhancing the quality of care services, further solidifying its investment appeal.
