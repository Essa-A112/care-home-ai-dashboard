The Local Authority District of Arun has shown promise in its care home investment potential with a score of 43.32, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key features contribute to this assessment. Arun benefits from a notable House Price Growth of 17.54%, indicating a positive economic environment for investment. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 19.81% suggests a favorable regulatory landscape. The district also boasts a significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 28.82%, highlighting a potential demand for care services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 76.42% may pose a competitive challenge for new investments. While the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively high, indicating market saturation, the overall score places Arun in a position where investment could be considered after further improvements. With a score below the threshold for direct investment suitability, focusing on enhancing care quality and addressing market saturation could elevate Arun to a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
