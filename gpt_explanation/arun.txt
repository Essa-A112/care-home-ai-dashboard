The Local Authority District of Arun demonstrates a promising care home investment potential with a score of 11.21, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Arun benefits from a robust House Price Growth of 15.36%, indicating a healthy economic environment. The significant percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 28.82% suggests a potential demand for care services. Moreover, the relatively high number of Care Homes per 10,000 residents and a solid Gross Disposable Household Income per head further support the attractiveness of the area for investment. However, the slightly lower percentage of Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated 'Good' at 76.42% poses a potential risk to consider.

While Arun shows promise for investment, particularly due to its positive economic indicators and demographic profile, the lower CQC rating compared to other factors indicates a need for improvement in care home quality. This suggests that with enhancements in care standards, Arun has the potential to become an even more attractive investment opportunity. Therefore, Arun falls within the category of being suitable for investment after potential improvements are made to address the CQC rating, ensuring a more comprehensive and balanced investment decision.
