The Local Authority District of Rushmoor has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.84, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement and a lower proportion of outstanding care homes indicate potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. Additionally, the moderate percentage of elderly residents combined with a below-average rate of house price growth may suggest a limited demand for care home services in the area. With a below-average number of care homes per 10,000 population, Rushmoor may face challenges in meeting the potential demand for care services in the future. Considering these factors, Rushmoor is currently deemed unsuitable for investment without significant improvements to address the identified weaknesses and mitigate potential risks associated with the care home market in the district.
