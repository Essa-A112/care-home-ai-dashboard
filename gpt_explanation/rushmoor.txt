The investment potential score of 29.60 for Rushmoor indicates that it falls into the "Avoid" category, suggesting caution for potential investors. This score is influenced by several key factors. The high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 15.25% is a concerning aspect, as it may indicate a greater demand for care services in the area. However, the presence of a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" and a high percentage rated as "Requires Improvement" or "Good" according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggests potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. On a positive note, the significant house price growth rate of 10.38% could indicate a stable and potentially lucrative property market.

Given the overall assessment, Rushmoor may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the combination of demographic challenges and quality concerns in the care home sector. However, with improvements in care home standards and potentially leveraging the positive house price growth, it could become a more viable option for investment in the future. Investors may need to closely monitor developments in the care sector and property market in Rushmoor before considering any investment decisions.
