The investment potential score of 2.45 for Epsom and Ewell suggests a moderate outlook for care home investments in the area. The relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement and the high proportion of care homes rated as good are positive indicators. However, the slower house price growth rate and the lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over could pose challenges for the care home market in the district. The positive impact of a sizable total population indicates potential demand for care services, but the lower proportion of elderly residents may limit the immediate market size. Investors should consider the balance between demand and competition in this area, as well as the potential for growth given the demographic trends and housing market dynamics.
