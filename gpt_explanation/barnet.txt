The Local Authority District of Barnet has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.62, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Barnet's relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with a healthy house price growth rate, are positive indicators for potential investment. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' and a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and over could be seen as drawbacks. Despite these factors, the district's Gross Disposable Household Income per capita in 2022 is a positive attribute. Overall, Barnet falls within the range that may be considered for investment after some improvements. While it does not currently meet the threshold for immediate investment suitability, with strategic enhancements in care home quality and potentially attracting more elderly residents, Barnet could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
