The investment potential score for East Devon is 8.00, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. East Devon demonstrates a positive trend in house price growth, indicating a potentially stable and growing property market. The relatively high percentage of the population aged 65 and over suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement and a lower proportion of outstanding-rated facilities pose challenges. While there is a strong percentage of care homes rated as good, the need for improvement in some facilities may require additional investment to enhance the overall quality of care provision in the district. Therefore, East Devon may be considered for investment after improvements to address the existing weaknesses and capitalize on its strengths in property market growth and demographic trends.
