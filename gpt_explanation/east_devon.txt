The Local Authority District of East Devon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.15, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. East Devon benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, standing at 13.33%, which is a positive indicator. Additionally, the region sees a healthy house price growth of 12.55% and has a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and above at 29.91%, both of which are favorable for care home investments. However, the area falls short in terms of the percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding," sitting at 18.67%, which could impact its overall attractiveness for investment. With a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents, East Devon presents a balanced landscape for potential investment. Despite its strengths, the overall score suggests that East Devon may not be the most ideal location for immediate investment but could be considered after improvements are made to enhance its care home offerings.
