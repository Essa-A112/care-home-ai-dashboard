The Local Authority District of Maidstone has an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.05, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and a relatively low percentage of 'Inadequate' facilities, the negative impacts of a significant proportion of homes requiring improvement and a below-average house price growth rate contribute to its overall low score. Additionally, with a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, the demand for care services might be limited in the area. Overall, Maidstone falls below the threshold for investment suitability, indicating that further improvements would be needed to make it a more viable option for care home investments.
