The Local Authority District of South Tyneside has an estimated care home investment potential score of 17.53, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by key factors such as a significant House Price Growth decrease of -41.63%, a relatively high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 10.81%, and a dominant presence of CQC Good ratings at 86.49%. While the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over stands at a positive 21.33%, indicating potential demand for care services, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively low at 2.48. Considering the overall profile, South Tyneside is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to the existing challenges in house prices and CQC performance. However, the aging population could present an opportunity for future improvement if the care home infrastructure is enhanced.
