The Local Authority District of South Tyneside has an estimated care home investment potential score of -6.39, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The significant negative impact of house price growth and the percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) contribute to the lower score. Additionally, the relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 further detracts from its investment potential. On the positive side, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is a strength, indicating a potentially higher demand for care services. However, the overall combination of negative influences outweighs this demographic advantage. Given the current profile, South Tyneside is not recommended for investment at this time due to the unfavorable indicators across various metrics.
