The Local Authority District of Coventry has an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.22, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed profile with both positive and negative contributing factors. Coventry demonstrates strengths in its relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 56.25%. However, there are notable weaknesses, such as a significant proportion of homes requiring improvement according to CQC data, at 42.5%. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low at 14.11%, potentially impacting the demand for care homes. The negative house price growth rate and the lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head further present challenges for investment attractiveness. While Coventry shows promise with its positive CQC ratings, the overall profile suggests that further improvements may be necessary to enhance its investment potential. As such, it falls within the category that may be considered for investment after addressing these factors.
