The Local Authority District of Coventry has an estimated care home investment potential score of 44.39, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Coventry demonstrates strengths in its relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 56.25%, with a further 1.25% rated as "Outstanding." However, the district also has a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, at 42.5%. Additionally, the negative house price growth of -13.72% poses a challenge to potential investors. Given these factors, Coventry falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements. While the district shows promise with its positive CQC ratings, the need for enhancement in certain areas, coupled with the decline in house prices, suggests that further evaluation and potential enhancements would be beneficial before committing to significant investment in care homes within this area.
