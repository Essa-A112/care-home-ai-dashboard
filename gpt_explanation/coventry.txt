The estimated care home investment potential score of 8.22 for Coventry suggests a moderately favorable environment for such investments. The district displays strengths in the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good standard of care provision. However, the significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement could pose a challenge, potentially necessitating additional resources for upgrades and improvements. Additionally, the negative impact of factors such as below-average house price growth, a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and over, and a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head may indicate potential risks for investment returns. While Coventry shows promise with its strong CQC ratings, addressing areas such as property market performance and demographic shifts will be crucial in maximizing the district's care home investment potential.
