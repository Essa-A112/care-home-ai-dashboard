The Local Authority District of Bath and North East Somerset has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.53, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score indicates moderate potential for investment in care homes within the area. The district's positive attributes include a healthy House Price Growth of 22.57%, a relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income per head of Â£24,779, and a notable absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission. However, the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC is 81.13%, which may have had a slightly negative impact on the overall score. As there are no care homes rated as "Outstanding," there is room for improvement in the quality of care facilities. While Bath and North East Somerset may not be the top choice for immediate investment, it could be a viable option for consideration with some enhancements in care home quality and potential market demand.
