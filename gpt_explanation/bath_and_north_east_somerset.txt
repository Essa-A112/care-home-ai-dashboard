The Local Authority District of Bath and North East Somerset has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 8.80, driven by several key factors. The strong house price growth percentage indicates a robust and growing property market, which can be advantageous for potential care home investments. Additionally, the relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 suggests a financially stable population that may be able to afford quality care services. However, the relatively lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and a notable proportion requiring improvement could pose challenges for investors, as improving these ratings may require additional investment or operational changes. The absence of care homes rated as "Outstanding" also indicates room for improvement in terms of service quality. Investors should carefully consider these factors and the associated risks when evaluating potential opportunities in the care home sector within Bath and North East Somerset.
