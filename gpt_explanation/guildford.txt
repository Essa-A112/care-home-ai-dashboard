The Local Authority District of Guildford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.08, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Guildford shows positive indicators in areas such as a high percentage of CQC rated 'Good' care homes at 72.41% and a relatively low percentage of homes requiring improvement at 24.14%. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is at a healthy level of Â£32,201. However, Guildford faces challenges with a slight decline in house price growth (-1.68%) and a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 17.21%. While Guildford falls below the threshold for direct investment suitability, its potential for improvement suggests it could be considered for investment after necessary enhancements. Careful consideration of these factors is advised to maximize investment returns and ensure the provision of quality care services in Guildford.
