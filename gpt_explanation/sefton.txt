The Local Authority District of Sefton has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.67, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Sefton exhibits a relatively low House Price Growth percentage of 2.98%, which could indicate a stagnant or declining property market. Additionally, the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission is 78.51%, suggesting room for improvement in overall care quality standards. On a positive note, Sefton has a higher percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 23.63%, indicating a potentially higher demand for care services. The presence of 4.28 care homes per 10,000 residents also signifies a decent infrastructure for care provision. However, the significant percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 19.01% poses a risk to potential investors. Given these factors, Sefton is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment, as improvements in property market performance and care quality standards are necessary to enhance its investment appeal.
