Surrey Heath's estimated care home investment potential score of -0.05 indicates a somewhat modest attractiveness for care home investment in the area. The negative house price growth percentage suggests a challenging real estate market, potentially affecting property values. The relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement and the limited number of care homes per 10,000 residents are weaknesses that could impact the quality and availability of care services in the district. However, the high percentage of CQC-rated good care homes and the sizable total population present strengths for potential investors. The positive impact of a larger population implies a potentially higher demand for care services. While there are risks associated with the current state of the real estate market and care home quality, the district's strengths in population size and quality care homes could offer opportunities for investors willing to navigate the challenges.
