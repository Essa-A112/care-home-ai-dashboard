The Local Authority District of Wakefield has a moderate care home investment potential score of 5.16, influenced by several key factors. The relatively low house price growth rate and below-average GDHI per head in 2022 suggest potential affordability challenges for care home investments. However, the higher percentage of CQC-rated Good care homes and lower percentage requiring improvement indicate a relatively strong existing care infrastructure within the district. The proportion of the population aged 65 and over being below the national average might pose a challenge in terms of immediate demand for care services. Nonetheless, this demographic trend also suggests potential for future growth in the care sector as the population ages. Investors should consider the balance between demand, existing infrastructure quality, and economic factors when assessing the opportunities and risks associated with investing in care homes in Wakefield.
