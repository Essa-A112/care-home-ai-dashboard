The Local Authority District of Ipswich has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.40, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. The negative impact from factors such as House Price Growth, the percentage of CQC Requiring Improvement, and the proportion of the population aged 65 and over contribute to this low score. While the district shows a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC, the presence of a significant number of homes requiring improvement or rated as 'Outstanding' may pose risks to potential investors. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering care home investment in Ipswich until improvements are made to address the existing challenges and risks.
