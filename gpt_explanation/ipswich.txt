The investment potential score of 1.40 for Ipswich suggests a moderately favorable environment for care home investments. The district's positive attributes include a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 65.38%, indicating a good standard of care provision. However, Ipswich faces challenges such as a negative house price growth rate of -3.52%, which may impact property values and investment returns. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (11.54%) and the relatively low percentage of 'Outstanding' rated homes (15.38%) indicate areas that need attention to enhance the overall quality of care services. With a moderate proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 17.0%, Ipswich presents both opportunities and risks for care home investments, depending on the ability to address the identified weaknesses and leverage its strengths to attract investment and deliver high-quality care services.
