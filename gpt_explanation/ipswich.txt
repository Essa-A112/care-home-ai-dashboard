The Local Authority District of Ipswich has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.15, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This assessment is influenced by several key factors. Ipswich shows strengths in its relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 65.38%, which is a positive indicator. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement (11.54%) and being rated as 'Inadequate' (7.69%) poses challenges. Additionally, the negative house price growth of -6.25% impacts the overall investment potential negatively. The district's low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 15.38% further contributes to the lower score. Given these factors, Ipswich is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment, as improvements in CQC ratings and house price growth are necessary to enhance its attractiveness for care home investments.
