The Local Authority District of Adur has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 7.09, falling within the "Consider" category. The district's strengths lie in its robust house price growth of 22.97%, indicating a healthy economic environment that could attract investment. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 5.56% and a high percentage of CQC rated as "Good" at 94.44% suggest a generally well-regulated and high-quality care provision. The demographic factor of nearly 24% of the population being over 65 also signals a potential demand for care services. However, the absence of care homes rated as "Outstanding" could pose a risk in terms of attracting premium clientele. While Adur may benefit from further improvements to enhance its attractiveness for investment, its current status warrants consideration for investment given its balanced mix of strengths and weaknesses.
