The Local Authority District of Adur has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.02, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district shows promising house price growth of 31.53%, indicating potential economic stability. Additionally, with 23.98% of the population aged 65 and above, there is a significant demographic in need of care services. However, Adur faces challenges as indicated by a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 94.44%, and a small proportion with an "Outstanding" rating at 0.0%. Moreover, the presence of 5.56% of care homes requiring improvement raises concerns about the overall quality of care facilities in the area. Considering these factors collectively, it is clear that while Adur has strengths such as demographic demand and economic growth potential, the current quality of care homes presents a significant risk, warranting caution in considering investment at this stage.
