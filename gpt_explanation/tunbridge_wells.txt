The Local Authority District of Tunbridge Wells has an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.60, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The significant negative impact comes from the low House Price Growth percentage and the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes rated as good by the CQC and a sizable total population are positive aspects. Despite these strengths, the overall score indicates that Tunbridge Wells may not be a favorable location for care home investment at present. The potential for improvement in CQC ratings and house price growth could make it a consideration for investment in the future, but current indicators suggest caution is warranted.
