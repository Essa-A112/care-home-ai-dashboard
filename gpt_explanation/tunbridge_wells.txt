The Local Authority District of Tunbridge Wells has an estimated care home investment potential score of 27.14, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative house price growth rate of -27.47% suggests a challenging economic environment for investment. Furthermore, the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (16.13%) and the lack of inadequate-rated care homes may indicate potential quality issues within the existing facilities. On a positive note, the district's sizable total population of 117,020 could present an opportunity for care home demand. However, the overall assessment suggests that Tunbridge Wells may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in house price growth and care home quality may make it a more viable option in the future.
