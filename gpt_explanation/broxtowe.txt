The Local Authority District of Broxtowe has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.56, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score suggests that Broxtowe may not be an ideal location for care home investments at present. The negative impact from house price growth, with a decrease of 19.53%, is a significant factor contributing to this rating. However, some positive aspects, such as a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 51.43% and a sizable population of individuals aged 65 and over at 21.83%, offer potential opportunities for improvement. On the other hand, the lower percentage of CQC-rated "Outstanding" care homes at 11.43% poses a challenge. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised regarding potential investments in care homes in Broxtowe. Further assessment and improvements may be necessary to enhance its investment attractiveness in the future.
