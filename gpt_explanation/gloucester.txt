The investment potential score for Gloucester, with a value of 33.41, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investments. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Gloucester's relatively low percentage of CQC Outstanding ratings at 12.0% and the high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 12.0% indicate potential quality concerns within the existing care home facilities. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is 17.02%, suggesting a higher demand for elderly care services that may strain current resources. However, the positive house price growth of 19.82% could signal a potential increase in property values, offering a financial advantage for investors. Overall, considering the overall score and a mix of strengths and weaknesses, Gloucester is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to the identified risks and areas for improvement within its care home sector.
