The investment potential for Gloucester, with a score of 5.11, falls within the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area has shown significant house price growth, which suggests a potentially attractive market. However, Gloucester faces challenges such as a relatively high percentage of the population over 65, which may increase demand for care services. Furthermore, a noteworthy portion of care providers in the area require improvement according to CQC ratings, indicating potential quality issues. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is relatively low, which could impact the affordability of care services in the area. Considering these factors, Gloucester may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at present, with improvements needed in various areas to enhance its attractiveness for investment.
