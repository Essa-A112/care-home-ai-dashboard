The Local Authority District of Bromsgrove has an estimated care home investment potential score of 42.09, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Bromsgrove exhibits a strong house price growth percentage of 22.89%, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is 23.0%, suggesting a demand for elderly care services. However, weaknesses are also present, as only 80.0% of care homes in Bromsgrove are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, with 17.78% requiring improvement. This indicates a need for quality enhancement in the care home sector. Despite these mixed indicators, the district's care homes per 10,000 population stand at 4.47, reflecting a relatively good provision of care facilities. Overall, Bromsgrove falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements, as there is potential for growth and demand, but addressing the quality of existing care homes is crucial to maximize investment returns and ensure high standards of care for residents.
