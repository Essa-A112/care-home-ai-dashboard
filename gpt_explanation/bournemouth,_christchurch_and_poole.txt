The investment potential score of 26.20 for the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Local Authority District suggests that it falls into the "Avoid" category for care home investment. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key factors. The relatively low percentages of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" and "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, coupled with modest house price growth, have contributed negatively to the overall score. On the positive side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over in the area and the number of care homes per 10,000 residents are relatively favorable. However, the overall balance of these factors indicates that the district may not currently present a strong investment opportunity. It is crucial to consider potential improvements in CQC ratings and house price growth to enhance investment viability. Therefore, at its current standing, it may be advisable to exercise caution and refrain from immediate investment in care homes within this LAD until these factors show improvement.
