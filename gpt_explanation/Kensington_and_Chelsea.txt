The investment potential score of 6.32 for Kensington and Chelsea suggests a relatively favorable outlook for care home investments in the area. This is supported by several key factors. The high GDHI per head in 2022 indicates a strong economic base, which can translate to greater spending power among residents for care services. Additionally, the significant percentage of care homes with a 'Good' CQC rating is a positive indicator of quality care provision. However, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over could pose a challenge in terms of demand for care services. Furthermore, the negative house price growth percentage may signal potential affordability issues for both care providers and residents. Overall, while there are strengths such as economic stability and quality care services, the lower elderly population percentage and negative house price growth present notable risks that investors should consider before making decisions in the care home sector in Kensington and Chelsea.
