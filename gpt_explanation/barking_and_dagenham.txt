The Local Authority District of Barking and Dagenham likely received a low care home investment potential score of -5.18 due to several key factors. The negative House_Price_Growth_% indicates a declining housing market, which could impact property values and potential returns on investment. The high %_CQC_Good at 86.36 suggests that there might be relatively fewer opportunities for improvement or development in the care home sector, potentially limiting growth prospects. Additionally, the relatively low Percent_65plus at 8.85 could indicate a smaller elderly population in need of care services, reducing demand for care homes. The presence of %_CQC_RequiresImprovement at 13.64 also highlights areas where the quality of care might need enhancement, posing risks for potential investors. Moreover, the GDHI_per_head_2022 value being at 19246 reflects a lower average income level, which could impact affordability for potential residents. Overall, while there may be strengths such as a higher percentage of good CQC ratings, the combination of these factors suggests challenges and limitations for care home investment in Barking and Dagenham.
