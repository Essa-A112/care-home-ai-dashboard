The Local Authority District of Barking and Dagenham has received a care home investment potential score of -5.18, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This negative score can be attributed to several key factors. The district exhibits a significant decline in House Price Growth, a high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission, and a relatively low proportion of residents aged 65 and over. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is comparatively low. These factors collectively suggest a challenging environment for care home investment in Barking and Dagenham. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to approach this district with caution. Further improvements in housing market performance, care home quality ratings, and demographic composition may be necessary to consider this area for investment in the future.
