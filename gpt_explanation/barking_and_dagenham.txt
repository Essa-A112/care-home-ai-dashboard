The Local Authority District of Barking and Dagenham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 14.43, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a substantial decline in House Price Growth, a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, and a relatively low proportion of the population aged 65 and over. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is comparatively lower, indicating potential financial constraints for residents. These combined factors suggest a challenging environment for care home investment in Barking and Dagenham. As such, it is not currently recommended for investment. However, with strategic improvements in housing market conditions, care home quality, and demographic trends, there may be potential for reconsideration in the future.
