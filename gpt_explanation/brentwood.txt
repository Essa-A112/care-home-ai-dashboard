The Local Authority District of Brentwood has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 7.15, influenced by various key features. Despite facing a slight decline in house price growth, the area shows promising signs with a significant proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC, indicating a strong quality of care provision. Moreover, Brentwood boasts a relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income per head and a sizable total population, suggesting a stable economic foundation and potential demand for care services. However, the relatively high percentage of CQC establishments requiring improvement highlights areas for enhancement in the local care sector. Investors should consider leveraging Brentwood's strengths in quality care provision and favorable economic indicators while addressing the need for improvements to mitigate potential risks and capitalize on the district's investment potential.
