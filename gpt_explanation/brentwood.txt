The Local Authority District of Brentwood has garnered an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.97, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Brentwood showcases strengths through a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 65.22%, along with a notable absence of homes rated as 'Inadequate' at 0.0%. However, challenges arise from a negative impact of -7.71% in house price growth, which could potentially affect the investment attractiveness. The presence of a significant percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 30.43% underscores areas that may need attention. Despite these factors, the district's overall score positions it in the mid-range for investment potential, suggesting that with strategic improvements, it could become a more viable investment option in the future.
