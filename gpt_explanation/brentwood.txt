The Local Authority District of Brentwood has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.15, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Brentwood shows positive indicators in terms of a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes and a lower percentage requiring improvement, which suggests a generally good quality of care provision. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is at a favorable level, indicating potential economic stability and residents' ability to afford care services. However, the negative impact of house price growth could pose challenges for care home affordability and accessibility in the area. With a moderately sized population, there is a solid base for demand for care services. Overall, while Brentwood shows promise with its strengths in care quality and economic indicators, the lower house price growth and potential competition in the market suggest that further improvements may be needed to maximize investment returns. Therefore, it falls into the category of being considered for investment after potential enhancements are made to address existing challenges.
