The investment potential score for Sunderland, with a rating of 14.99, places it in the 'Avoid' category for care home investment. This is primarily due to several key factors. The negative impact on the score comes from a significant decline in House Price Growth (-31.94%) and a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 90.22%. Moreover, the GDHI per head in 2022 is relatively low at Â£17,458. On a positive note, Sunderland has a slightly higher percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 20.85%, which could indicate a potential demand for care services. However, the overall low score suggests that significant improvements would be needed to make this area suitable for investment in care homes. Given the current data, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in Sunderland until there are notable improvements in the aforementioned factors.
