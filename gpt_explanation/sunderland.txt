The Local Authority District of Sunderland has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of -7.10, categorizing it under the "Avoid" classification. This score is influenced by several key factors. Sunderland exhibits a negative impact on house price growth, standing at -24.29%, indicating a potential lack of growth in property values. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 90.22% suggests a competitive market with limited room for improvement. The low percentage of CQC-rated care homes requiring improvement at 1.09% and the relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head at Â£17,458 further contribute to the negative score. While Sunderland does have a notable percentage of CQC-rated care homes classified as "Outstanding" at 6.52%, these strengths are outweighed by the overall negative indicators. Therefore, based on the investment potential score and the aforementioned factors, Sunderland is deemed unsuitable for investment at this time.
