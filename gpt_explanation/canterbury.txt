The Local Authority District of Canterbury has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 7.93, driven by several key factors. The area benefits from a significant percentage of the population aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. Moreover, a high proportion of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests an existing infrastructure to support the aging population. The relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes is another positive indicator of quality in the sector. However, there are areas of concern such as the negative impact of house price growth, which could affect affordability for both care providers and residents. Additionally, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement warrants attention, signaling potential quality issues that investors may need to address. Overall, while Canterbury shows promise for care home investment due to its demographic profile and existing care infrastructure, mitigating risks related to affordability and quality improvement will be crucial for maximizing returns in this market.
