The Local Authority District of Canterbury has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.88, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score suggests a moderate level of suitability for investment, indicating room for improvement. Canterbury shows strengths in its relatively low percentages of care homes rated as requiring improvement (20.55%) and inadequate (5.48%) by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which positively impact its overall potential. Additionally, with 22.17% of its population aged 65 and over and a favorable number of care homes per 10,000 residents, Canterbury demonstrates a growing demand for elderly care services. However, the modest house price growth rate of 2.57% presents a slight challenge, indicating potential limitations in property market dynamics. While Canterbury may benefit from targeted enhancements to further boost its investment appeal, it falls within a range where cautious consideration is warranted. As such, investors may find potential in Canterbury with strategic improvements to capitalize on its strengths and address areas of weakness for optimal returns.
