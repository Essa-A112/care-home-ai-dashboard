The Local Authority District of Basingstoke and Deane has an estimated care home investment potential score of 32.32, classifying it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district shows a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 83.33%, which negatively impacts its overall score. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is 17.72%, suggesting a potentially lower demand for care services. On a positive note, the district has experienced a significant house price growth of 16.19%, indicating a potential for a favorable economic environment. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 9.26% could pose risks to potential investors. Overall, due to the combination of lower demand indicators and the need for improvement in a portion of care homes, investing in Basingstoke and Deane may not be advisable at this time.
