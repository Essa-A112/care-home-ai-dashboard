The Local Authority District of Basingstoke and Deane has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.77, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. While the area shows positive house price growth, indicating a potentially stable market, it faces challenges with a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of outstanding CQC-rated care homes and a smaller proportion of residents aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services. These factors collectively suggest that Basingstoke and Deane may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in CQC ratings and an aging population trend could potentially make this area more attractive for investment in the future.
