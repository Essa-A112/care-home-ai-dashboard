Mid Suffolk has a promising care home investment potential score of 14.33, primarily driven by several key factors. The district boasts a robust house price growth of 18.47%, indicating a strong and stable housing market that could attract potential investors. Additionally, with 58.33% of care facilities rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and only 25% requiring improvement, Mid Suffolk demonstrates a commitment to high-quality elderly care services. The relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 25.48% further suggests a demand for senior care facilities in the area. However, the lower percentage of care facilities rated as 'Outstanding' at 8.33% could be a potential weakness to address. Overall, while Mid Suffolk presents a positive investment outlook due to its growing housing market and quality care services, investors should consider enhancing the outstanding care facilities to mitigate risks and capitalize on the district's advantages.
