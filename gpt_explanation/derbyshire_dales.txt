The investment potential score for Derbyshire Dales is 32.08, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, potentially indicating a demand for care home services. Additionally, the strong house price growth suggests a stable and potentially lucrative property market. However, these strengths are counteracted by some concerning aspects. The low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) raises questions about the quality of existing facilities. Moreover, the significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement is another red flag. Given these factors, investing in Derbyshire Dales at this time may not be advisable due to the current conditions that suggest potential challenges in the care home sector.
