Derbyshire Dales has a moderately high estimated care home investment potential score of 5.55. This is likely due to its relatively positive House Price Growth, which can indicate a prosperous local economy and potential for strong returns on property investments. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is also relatively high, suggesting a potentially higher demand for care home services in the area. However, the fact that a small percentage of care homes in the district require improvement according to the CQC could pose a risk to potential investors, as it may indicate quality issues within the existing care facilities. The high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes is a strength, reflecting a level of quality and standardization in the care provided. Overall, Derbyshire Dales presents opportunities for investment in the care home sector, but investors should be cautious of potential quality concerns in some facilities.
