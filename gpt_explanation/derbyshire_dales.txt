The investment potential score for Derbyshire Dales is 5.55, categorizing it as a location to avoid for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potential demand for care services. Additionally, the growth in house prices is favorable, suggesting a stable and potentially profitable investment environment. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) may indicate strong competition in the market. Furthermore, the presence of a significant portion of care homes requiring improvement raises concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. With these factors in mind, Derbyshire Dales is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to the overall lower investment potential score. Further improvements in care home quality and market conditions may make it a more viable option in the future.
