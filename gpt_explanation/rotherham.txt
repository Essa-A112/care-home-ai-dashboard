The Local Authority District of Rotherham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.03, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Rotherham exhibits a positive House Price Growth of 20.7%, indicating a potentially favorable market for property investment. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (19.8%) suggests a higher quality of care within the district. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 73.27% may impact the potential for improvements and investment opportunities. Furthermore, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is lower at 17739, which could affect the affordability of care services in the area. Considering these factors, Rotherham shows promise for investment potential but may benefit from further enhancements to attract more significant investment. It falls within the range where improvements could lead to increased investment suitability.
