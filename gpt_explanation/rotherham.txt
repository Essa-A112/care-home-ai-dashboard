The Local Authority District of Rotherham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 9.42, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Rotherham demonstrates a robust house price growth percentage, indicating a positive trend in the housing market. However, the GDHI per head in 2022 is relatively low, suggesting potential economic challenges. The percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the CQC is below average, which could impact the overall quality of care in the area. On a positive note, Rotherham boasts a higher than average number of care homes per 10,000 residents, indicating a strong demand for care services. Despite its strengths, the total population figure suggests a potential strain on resources. Given these factors, Rotherham may be considered for investment after improvements to address economic concerns and enhance care quality.
