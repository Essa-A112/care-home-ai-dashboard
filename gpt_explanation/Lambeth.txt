The investment potential score of 0.31 for Lambeth, a Local Authority District, reveals a mixed profile. The negative impact of house price growth and the percentage of the population aged 65 and over suggest potential challenges in the real estate market and the demand for care homes. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission indicates a strong quality of care infrastructure, which could be an attractive factor for investors. The relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement is also a positive indicator. Furthermore, Lambeth's Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively healthy, indicating a potentially stable economic environment for investments. Despite these strengths, the negative house price growth and the aging population could pose risks in terms of property market dynamics and future care home demand. Investors should consider these factors along with the existing quality of care infrastructure when assessing investment opportunities in Lambeth.
