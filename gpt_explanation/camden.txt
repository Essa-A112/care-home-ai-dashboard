The Local Authority District of Camden has received an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.18, positioning it in the 'Consider' category. This score reflects a mixed profile with both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, Camden benefits from a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 60%. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is notably robust at Â£58,440, indicating potential financial stability in the area. However, challenges exist as well, such as a significant negative impact from a decrease in House Price Growth at -22.29%. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 11.67% may limit the immediate demand for care home services. Considering these factors, while Camden shows promise in certain areas, further improvements may be necessary to fully capitalize on its investment potential. Therefore, it falls into a category that could benefit from investment after careful consideration and potential enhancements.
