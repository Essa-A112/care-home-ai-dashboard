The Local Authority District of Reigate and Banstead has a moderate care home investment potential score of 3.93, influenced by several key features. The area shows strengths in the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 71.43%, indicating a strong quality of care provision. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 22.08% suggests a lower risk of regulatory issues. However, the negative impact of a high percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 17.97% could pose a challenge due to potentially increased demand for care services. The negative house price growth percentage may indicate a potential economic strain on the area, affecting property values and potentially investment opportunities. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 at Â£29,893 indicates a relatively affluent population, which could support private-pay care home models. Overall, Reigate and Banstead presents a mixed picture for care home investment, with quality care provision and income levels as strengths, but challenges in demographic trends and property market performance.
