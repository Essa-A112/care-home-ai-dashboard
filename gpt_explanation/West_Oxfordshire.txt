West Oxfordshire has shown promising indicators for potential care home investment with a score of 7.68. The district benefits from a strong house price growth of 11.35%, indicating a healthy and growing property market which could attract investors. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of the population aged 65 and above at 22.04% suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. However, there are some areas of concern such as the percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 16.67% and the lower percentage of CQC rated as good at 76.67%. These factors may pose challenges in terms of ensuring high-quality care services in the region. It is crucial for investors to address these weaknesses and assess the risks involved in the care home sector in West Oxfordshire. Despite these challenges, the district's relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 at Â£28,583 provides a positive outlook for potential investment returns in the long term.
