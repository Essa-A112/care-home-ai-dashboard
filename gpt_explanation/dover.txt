The Local Authority District of Dover has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.99, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is primarily influenced by several positive factors, including strong house price growth, a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above, a moderate level of care homes per 10,000 people, and a lower percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). However, the presence of a lower percentage of CQC-rated 'Outstanding' care homes has a slight negative impact on the score. Overall, Dover shows promise for care home investments but may benefit from enhancements in the quality of existing care facilities to further improve its investment potential. While not yet optimal for immediate investment, with some improvements, Dover could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the near future.
