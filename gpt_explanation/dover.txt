The Local Authority District of Dover has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.80, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Dover benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, standing at 21.31%, and a healthy house price growth rate of 11.58%. Additionally, the district has a significant population of individuals aged 65 and older, at 24.53%, indicating a potential demand for care services. However, Dover does have a high proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which may limit opportunities for improvement and growth. Furthermore, the percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" is relatively low at 6.56%, suggesting room for enhancement in care quality. Considering these factors, Dover falls within the range of consideration for investment potential. While there are strengths such as a growing housing market and a sizeable elderly population, the presence of a significant number of "Good" rated care homes and a relatively low percentage of "Outstanding" rated homes indicate areas for development. With strategic improvements, Dover could potentially become a more attractive investment option in the future.
