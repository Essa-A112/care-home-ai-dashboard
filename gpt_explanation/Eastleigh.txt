The Local Authority District of Eastleigh has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 6.44, indicating a favorable environment for care home investments. One key strength contributing to this score is the high percentage of care homes that have received a CQC rating of 'Good', which instills confidence in the quality of care provided in the area. Additionally, the moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests a demand for care services that is being met adequately. However, the negative impact of house price growth may pose a challenge for investors looking to acquire properties for care homes, as it could affect the overall investment returns. Furthermore, the percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement highlights an area for potential risk, indicating room for enhancement in certain care facilities. Overall, Eastleigh presents a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, with a strong foundation in quality care provision but potential challenges related to property costs and areas needing improvement in care services.
