The Local Authority District of Buckinghamshire has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 10.83, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by the district's high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (62.6%) and a relatively low percentage requiring improvement (29.77%). Additionally, Buckinghamshire exhibits a strong Gross Disposable Household Income per capita in 2022, standing at Â£30,659, which is a positive factor for investment. However, challenges exist, such as a moderate house price growth rate of 6.01% and a large total population of 566,694, which could impact demand for care home services. While not yet optimal for immediate investment, Buckinghamshire's potential suggests that with targeted improvements, it could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
