The Local Authority District of Buckinghamshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 47.41, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by factors such as a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), along with a notable percentage rated as 'Outstanding'. Additionally, the region has seen a healthy house price growth percentage. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement is a weakness that may impact the overall investment attractiveness. The total population figure also negatively affects the score. Overall, while Buckinghamshire falls within the range that may be considered for investment after improvements, the presence of both strengths and weaknesses suggests a cautious approach. Further evaluation and targeted improvements in care home quality could enhance its investment potential.
