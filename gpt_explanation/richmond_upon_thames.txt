The investment potential score of 2.70 for the Richmond upon Thames Local Authority District can be attributed to a mix of factors. One of its strengths lies in its relatively high GDHI per head value, indicating a potentially affluent population with higher disposable income levels. However, the district's high percentage of CQC rated 'Good' care homes may have contributed to a negative impact on the score, suggesting a saturated market with limited room for growth or differentiation. Additionally, the low percentage of CQC rated 'Requires Improvement' homes could indicate a lack of potential turnaround opportunities for investors. The modest house price growth and relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over may pose risks in terms of demand for care home services in the future. Overall, while Richmond upon Thames has some positive indicators, such as strong economic fundamentals, it also faces challenges in terms of market saturation and demographic trends that could impact its care home investment potential.
