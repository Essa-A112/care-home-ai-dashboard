Richmond upon Thames has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.66, categorizing it as an "Avoid" location. This score reflects a combination of factors that influence investment suitability. While the area benefits from a healthy house price growth rate of 6.05%, indicating a potentially stable market, it faces challenges such as a low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 16.81%. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC at 95.65% suggests limited room for improvement in care services. The absence of care homes requiring improvement (0.0%) could indicate a lack of investment opportunities for enhancement. With a total population of 195,513, the market size may be limited for care home services. Overall, based on these factors, Richmond upon Thames is deemed unsuitable for direct investment at this time, as the potential for growth or improvement in care home services appears limited.
