Richmond upon Thames has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.70, placing it in the Avoid category. The district's high percentage of care homes rated as Good by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) could be seen as a strength, indicating good quality care provision. However, the lack of care homes requiring improvement and a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 plus may limit the demand for additional care facilities. Additionally, the modest house price growth and lower proportion of elderly residents might suggest a potentially less lucrative market for care home investments. While the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head is relatively high, indicating potential spending power, the overall profile suggests limited immediate investment potential in the care home sector for Richmond upon Thames.
