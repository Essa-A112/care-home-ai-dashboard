The Local Authority District of Chelmsford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.63, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. While the percentage of care homes with a "Good" rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 74.19%, other metrics such as the negative impact of house price growth and the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over contribute to the overall score. Additionally, the percentages of care homes rated as "Outstanding" and those needing improvement are not as favorable, further impacting the investment potential. Based on these features and values, Chelmsford may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the lower overall score and potential risks associated with the current state of care homes in the area. Further improvements in CQC ratings and demographic factors could potentially make it a more viable option for investment in the future.
