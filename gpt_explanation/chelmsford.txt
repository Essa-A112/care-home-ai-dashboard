Chelmsford's care home investment potential score of 33.71 places it in the 'Avoid' category, indicating caution for investment. The negative impact on the score is primarily influenced by factors such as a decrease in House Price Growth, a lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC, and a relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 residents. However, there are positive aspects to consider, such as a lower percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings. Overall, the current state suggests that Chelmsford may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at the moment. Further improvements in house price growth and increasing the number of high-quality care homes could potentially shift its status to being considered for investment in the future.
