The Local Authority District of Harrow received a care home investment potential score of 1.83, reflecting a mixed outlook. Despite a positive influence from robust house price growth of over 12%, certain key factors are impacting its score. The relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 93.1% suggests room for improvement in the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, a notable proportion of the population being 65 years and older, combined with a large total population, indicate potential strain on care services in the future. These factors may pose challenges for investors looking to capitalize on the care home market in Harrow. However, the strong house price growth could offer an advantage for those willing to invest in improving or expanding care facilities to cater to the growing elderly population. It's essential for investors to carefully weigh these factors to make informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with investing in the care home sector in Harrow.
