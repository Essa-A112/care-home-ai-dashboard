The investment potential score for South Kesteven is 31.21, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district's relatively high percentage of CQC requires improvement at 12.9% and a low house price growth rate of 0.54% have negatively impacted its potential for care home investment. However, South Kesteven does have strengths such as a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 23.57%, which could indicate a potential demand for care services. Despite this, the lack of any inadequate CQC ratings and a notable percentage of outstanding ratings at 9.68% suggest a mixed landscape for care home investment in the area. Overall, based on the current data and score, South Kesteven is not recommended for immediate investment but could be considered for future opportunities with improvements in certain areas.
