The Local Authority District of Newark and Sherwood has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.22, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The district shows a robust House Price Growth percentage of 14.02%, indicating a positive trend in the local housing market. Additionally, with 22.84% of the population aged 65 and over, there is a potential demand for care services. However, there are areas for improvement, such as the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings at 15.38%. Furthermore, the lower percentages of care homes with "Good" and "Outstanding" ratings at 76.92% and 7.69% respectively suggest room for enhancement in care quality. Overall, while Newark and Sherwood shows promise with its housing market growth and aging population, the need for improvements in care home quality and ratings indicates that it may be worth considering for investment after addressing these weaknesses to maximize the district's potential for care home investments.
