The Local Authority District of Newark and Sherwood has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.01, placing it in the "Consider" category. The positive feature values include a healthy House Price Growth of 15.4%, reflecting a potentially buoyant property market, and a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 22.84%, suggesting a demand for elderly care services. However, the presence of 15.38% of CQC establishments requiring improvement and lower percentages of CQC Outstanding and Good ratings at 7.69% and 76.92% respectively indicate areas that may need attention. While the district's score falls below the threshold for direct investment suitability, it may be worth considering after addressing the areas of improvement highlighted by the CQC ratings. This cautious approach is advisable to mitigate risks associated with the current quality levels of care homes in the area.
