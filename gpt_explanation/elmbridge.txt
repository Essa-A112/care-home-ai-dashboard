Elmbridge, as a Local Authority District, has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.44, largely due to several key positive indicators. The district boasts a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good standard of care provision. Additionally, Elmbridge benefits from a strong Gross Disposable Household Income per capita and a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC.

Overall, Elmbridge's favorable demographic and economic indicators position it as a promising location for care home investment.
