Elmbridge has a care home investment potential score of 44.34, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mix of positive and negative factors. The district boasts a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a generally high standard of care provision. Additionally, strong house price growth and a high Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head suggest a stable economic environment that could support care home investments. However, a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, while positive for care quality, may limit potential returns for investors. The absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" is a positive indicator. Overall, Elmbridge falls just below the threshold for direct investment suitability, indicating that while it shows promise, some enhancements may be needed to optimize investment opportunities in the care home sector within this district.
