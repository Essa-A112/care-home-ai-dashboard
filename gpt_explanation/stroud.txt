The Local Authority District of Stroud has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 8.80, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Stroud benefits from a robust House Price Growth percentage of 12.03%, indicating a healthy property market. Moreover, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is substantial at 23.64%, suggesting a potential demand for care home services. On the downside, the percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission stands at 18.6%, highlighting areas that may need enhancement. Despite this, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' at 81.4% is a notable strength. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is also positive at Â£25,260. While Stroud falls short of being an immediate investment opportunity, its potential for improvement makes it a candidate for future consideration after necessary enhancements are made to address the identified weaknesses.
