The Local Authority District of Doncaster has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.67, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key factors contribute to this score. Doncaster exhibits a positive House Price Growth of 11.84%, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. However, the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is at 76.09%, which may raise concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is 18280, which could impact the affordability of care services in the area. Notably, the percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" is at 18.48%, suggesting room for enhancement in the sector. While the percentage of inadequate care homes is relatively low at 3.26%, it still poses a risk to potential investors. Overall, Doncaster falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements, as there are strengths such as economic growth potential, but weaknesses in care quality and income levels that require attention before full-scale investment.
