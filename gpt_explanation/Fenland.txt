The investment potential score of 3.95 for Fenland suggests a moderately favorable outlook for care home investments in this Local Authority District. The relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 23.39% indicates a potentially strong demand for elderly care services, which is a positive aspect for investors. However, the lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 83.33% and the presence of a considerable proportion rated as 'Requires Improvement' at 13.33% highlight areas of concern regarding the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, the below-average Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 at Â£19,121 could indicate potential affordability challenges for residents seeking care services. The negative impact of house price growth and GDHI on the investment score further underscores the financial constraints within the region that could affect the viability of care home investments. Investors should carefully consider these factors, balancing the demand from the aging population with the quality and affordability of care services in Fenland to make informed investment decisions.
