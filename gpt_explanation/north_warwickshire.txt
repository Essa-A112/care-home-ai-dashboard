The investment potential score of 5.15 for North Warwickshire places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential investors. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. While the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively high at 22.1%, a positive indicator for care home investment, other critical metrics such as House Price Growth and GDHI per head in 2022 have negative impacts. The presence of 3.78 care homes per 10,000 residents and a CQC Good rating of 80% provide some strengths. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for favorable investment. Given the mix of positive and negative influences, North Warwickshire may not currently be the most attractive option for care home investment. Further analysis and potential improvements in certain areas could make it more viable in the future.
