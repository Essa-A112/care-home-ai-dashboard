The Local Authority District of North Kesteven has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.80, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, North Kesteven has a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, which suggests a potential demand for care home services. Additionally, the district boasts a significant proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good quality of care provision. However, North Kesteven also has a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement and a lower percentage rated as "Outstanding," posing potential risks in terms of overall care quality. Despite the positive aspects, the overall score suggests that North Kesteven may not currently be the most attractive option for care home investment. Further improvements in CQC ratings and addressing areas requiring improvement could potentially shift its suitability for investment in the future.
