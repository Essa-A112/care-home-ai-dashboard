Stockport, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 9.18, falls into the "Consider" category. This score suggests that while there are positive aspects, there are also areas that may need improvement to fully maximize investment potential. Stockport benefits from a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC, indicating a strong quality of care in the region. Additionally, the presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" further enhances its appeal. However, challenges lie in the relatively high proportion of the population over 65 years old and the significant total population, which could strain care resources. With a score below the threshold for direct investment suitability, Stockport may require enhancements in care infrastructure and services to fully capitalize on its potential. By addressing these areas, Stockport could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
