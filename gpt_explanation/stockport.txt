The Local Authority District of Stockport has an estimated care home investment potential score of 42.84, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Stockport benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), with only 28.57% falling in this category. Additionally, the presence of a small but notable percentage of outstanding CQC-rated care homes at 1.43% is a positive indicator. However, the modest house price growth of 4.74% and a relatively small percentage of inadequate-rated care homes at 0.0% slightly dampen the overall score. The demographic composition of 20.21% of the population being 65 years and older is a contributing factor to its favorable rating. While Stockport falls slightly below the threshold for immediate investment suitability, it shows promise and could be considered for investment after some improvements are made to address the existing weaknesses. With a balanced mix of strengths and weaknesses, Stockport presents a potential opportunity for future care home investment once certain aspects are enhanced.
