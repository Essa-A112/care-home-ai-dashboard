The Local Authority District of Rother has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.07, driven by several key features. The district's strong House_Price_Growth_% of 18.11% indicates a favorable real estate market, potentially attracting investors. However, the relatively high %_CQC_RequiresImprovement and %_CQC_Good scores suggest a mixed quality of care homes in the area, posing a challenge for potential investors. On the positive side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is significant at 32.52%, indicating a potentially high demand for care services. Additionally, the GDHI_per_head_2022 value of Â£24,725 suggests a relatively affluent population that may be willing to pay for premium care services. Despite the challenges posed by the variation in CQC ratings, the demographic factors and economic indicators present opportunities for strategic investment in the care home sector within the Rother district.
