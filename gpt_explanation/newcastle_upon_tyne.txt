The Local Authority District of Newcastle upon Tyne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.29, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of a declining House Price Growth percentage and a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above indicate potential challenges for attracting investment in care homes. Additionally, the lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 further dampens the investment outlook. On a positive note, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) could be seen as a strength. However, the notable presence of care homes requiring improvement, along with the overall lower economic indicators, suggests that significant improvements would be needed to make this area more attractive for care home investments. Given these factors, investing in care homes in Newcastle upon Tyne may not be advisable at present.
