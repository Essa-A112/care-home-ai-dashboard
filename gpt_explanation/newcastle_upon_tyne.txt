The Local Authority District of Newcastle upon Tyne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.55, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The negative house price growth rate of -13.86% indicates a declining property market, potentially impacting the overall investment returns. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 14.93% suggests a smaller target demographic for care home services. The distribution of CQC ratings also plays a role, with a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' at 73.08%, potentially indicating a competitive market. While the absence of 'Inadequate' rated care homes is a positive aspect, the overall picture suggests limited growth potential for care home investments in this area. Therefore, based on the current data and score, Newcastle upon Tyne is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment.
