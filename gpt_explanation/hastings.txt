Hastings, as an investment prospect for care homes, presents a promising scenario with an estimated potential score of 10.87, placing it in the 'Consider' category. The district's positive attributes include a robust House Price Growth percentage of 19.22, indicating a favorable economic environment for investment. Moreover, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 22.54% suggests a generally well-performing care sector. The high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 76.06% is a notable strength, reflecting existing quality standards. Additionally, the significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 20.8% highlights a potential demand for care services. However, the relatively low Care Homes per 10k figure of 7.82 could be seen as a weakness, indicating a possible undersupply of care facilities. Despite its overall positive aspects, Hastings falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability. With some improvements in care home availability and potentially addressing any existing gaps, the district could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
