The Local Authority District of Hastings has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 44.36, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Hastings displays a positive House Price Growth of 22.78%, indicating a favorable economic environment for potential investments. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of care homes with CQC ratings requiring improvement at 22.54% is a positive indicator. However, the high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" at 76.06% could be seen as a weakness, potentially suggesting a saturated market. The absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" is a positive aspect. With 7.82 care homes per 10,000 people, there is a promising availability of care facilities in the area. Overall, while Hastings falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, it presents opportunities that could be explored after further improvements to enhance its attractiveness to investors.
