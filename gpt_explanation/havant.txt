The Local Authority District of Havant has a promising estimated care home investment potential score of 11.74, driven by several key factors. With a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC data at 31.03%, Havant demonstrates a strong foundation in quality care provision. The significant presence of individuals aged 65 or older at 24.86% suggests a potentially robust demand for care services in the area. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC at 68.97% reflects a track record of delivering satisfactory care standards. Furthermore, the positive house price growth of 8.84% indicates a healthy economic environment that may support investment opportunities. However, the absence of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' poses a challenge in terms of standing out in a competitive market. While Havant showcases strengths in care quality and market demand, potential risks could arise from the need for continuous improvement to meet the evolving expectations of residents and investors alike.
