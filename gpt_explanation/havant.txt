The Local Authority District of Havant has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 47.64, positioning it within the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced positively by several key factors. Notably, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (31.03%) and a high percentage of good CQC ratings (68.97%) indicate a generally favorable quality of care provision. Additionally, the area benefits from a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over (24.86%), suggesting a potential demand for care services. House price growth of 10.3% further enhances the investment attractiveness of the district. However, the score is somewhat tempered by a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents (4.61). While Havant falls just below the threshold for direct investment suitability, its positive attributes indicate potential for growth with targeted improvements. Therefore, with strategic enhancements to address existing limitations, Havant could become a more viable investment opportunity in the future.
