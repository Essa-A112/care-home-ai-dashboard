The care home investment potential score for South Oxfordshire is -0.63, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a decline in house price growth percentage and a notable proportion of care facilities requiring improvement, which could pose challenges for potential investors. On a positive note, South Oxfordshire boasts a high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes, indicating a level of quality in the existing facilities. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is relatively high, suggesting a potentially affluent client base. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, primarily due to the negative impact of house price growth and CQC ratings requiring improvement. Therefore, investors should exercise caution when considering care home investments in South Oxfordshire until these factors show improvement.
