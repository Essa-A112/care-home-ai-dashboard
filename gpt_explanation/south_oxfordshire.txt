The South Oxfordshire Local Authority District has received an estimated care home investment potential score of 25.74, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a relatively low percentage of CQC outstanding ratings at 14.29%, coupled with a notable percentage of properties experiencing house price growth decline at -9.55%. These aspects contribute negatively to the overall investment potential. On a positive note, the district boasts a significant 21.04% of individuals aged 65 and over, indicating a potential demand for care services. However, the presence of a relatively high percentage of CQC requires improvement at 8.57% suggests room for enhancement in care quality. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, South Oxfordshire is currently deemed unsuitable for direct investment. Further improvements in care quality and housing market performance could potentially enhance its investment prospects in the future.
