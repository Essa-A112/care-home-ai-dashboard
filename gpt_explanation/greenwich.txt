The estimated care home investment potential score of -1.05 for Greenwich indicates a less favorable outlook for care home investments in this Local Authority District. The negative SHAP impact of various key features such as House Price Growth, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, and the proportion of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) contribute to this score. The relatively low House Price Growth suggests a subdued housing market, which may affect the overall economic health of the area. Additionally, the higher percentage of elderly residents and a significant proportion of care homes rated as requiring improvement point to potential challenges in providing quality care services. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC could be seen as a strength, indicating some existing quality care provisions. Overall, investors should consider the aging population, housing market trends, and the need for potential improvements in care services when evaluating investment opportunities in care homes within Greenwich.
