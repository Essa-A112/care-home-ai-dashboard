The Local Authority District of Greenwich has an estimated care home investment potential score of 21.75, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. Several key features contribute to this score: a significant House Price Growth decrease of -34.35%, a notable percentage of CQC Requiring Improvement at 16.28%, a relatively low percentage of 65+ residents at 10.72%, and a high CQC Good rating of 83.72%. However, the positive impact of a relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 at 26020 offers a potential opportunity for improvement. Overall, the combination of negative factors such as the housing market decline, the need for CQC improvements, and a lower proportion of elderly residents outweigh the positive income per capita. Therefore, at the current score, Greenwich is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. Further enhancements in housing market stability and care quality could potentially shift its investment potential in the future.
