The investment potential score for Greenwich is -1.05, categorizing it as an area to avoid for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Firstly, the negative house price growth percentage indicates a decline in property values, potentially impacting the overall investment return. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC Good ratings and a higher percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings suggest potential quality concerns within existing care homes in the area. The proportion of residents aged 65 and over being relatively low could indicate a lower demand for care services. While there are no outstanding CQC-rated care homes, this could be viewed as a positive aspect. Overall, due to the combination of declining house prices, quality issues, and lower demand potential, Greenwich is not currently considered suitable for care home investment and may require significant improvements before being considered as a viable investment opportunity.
