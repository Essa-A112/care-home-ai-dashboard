Reading has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 40.97, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by various factors. On the positive side, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC data, at 25.81%, and strong house price growth of 15.25% suggest a promising investment environment. However, challenges exist, such as a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 12.2%, which may limit the demand for care services. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC at 67.74% and a smaller number rated as "Outstanding" at 6.45% indicate potential competition and saturation in the market. Overall, while Reading offers opportunities for investment due to positive trends in care quality and property market growth, further improvements may be needed to enhance its attractiveness for care home investments.
