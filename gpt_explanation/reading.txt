Reading has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 7.07, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district benefits from a healthy house price growth rate of 11.70%, indicating a positive trend for property value appreciation. Additionally, a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC at 67.74% enhances the overall quality of care services in the area. However, challenges exist with a lower percentage of the population aged 65 and above at 12.2%, potentially impacting the demand for care services. Moreover, the limited number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 1.74 could indicate a gap in supply relative to potential demand. Despite these weaknesses, Reading's favorable house price growth and strong CQC ratings suggest the potential for growth in the care home sector. Therefore, while improvements may be needed to address demographic factors, Reading could be a viable option for investment consideration.
