The investment potential score for Winchester stands at 6.07, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This assessment is influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 66.67%, indicating a certain level of quality in the local care services, the low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 12.12% may raise concerns. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth and outstanding CQC ratings on the score suggests potential challenges in the local housing market and care home sector. On a positive note, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively strong at Â£29,584, indicating a level of economic stability. However, given the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised. Further improvements in housing market conditions and CQC ratings could potentially enhance the investment potential in Winchester in the future.
