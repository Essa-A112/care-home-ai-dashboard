The Local Authority District of Warwick has an estimated care home investment potential score of 29.47, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the district boasts a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 85%, indicating a strong quality of care provision, other metrics weigh down its overall score. The presence of care homes requiring improvement, along with a lower percentage of 'Outstanding' rated facilities and a negative house price growth trend of -5.0%, contribute to the less favorable investment outlook. Given the composite score falling below the threshold for consideration, it is advisable to exercise caution in pursuing care home investments in the Warwick LAD until improvements in the aforementioned areas are observed.
