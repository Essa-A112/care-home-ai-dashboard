The Local Authority District of Warwick has been assessed to have a care home investment potential score of 1.38, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several factors. Warwick exhibits a negative impact on house price growth, the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC, the proportion of the population aged 65 and above, and the percentage of care homes requiring improvement. These aspects indicate potential challenges in the care home market within this district. However, one positive aspect is the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022, which has a positive impact on the investment potential score. Overall, with a score below the threshold for investment suitability, Warwick is deemed unsuitable for direct investment at this time. Further improvements in the aforementioned areas may warrant reconsideration in the future.
