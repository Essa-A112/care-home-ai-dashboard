The Local Authority District of Warwick has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.38, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for such investments. Several key features contribute to this score. Warwick's negative house price growth percentage suggests a potential weakness in the local housing market. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) could pose a risk for potential investors. The relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over may indicate lower immediate demand for care home services. On the positive side, Warwick's Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively high, indicating a potentially more affluent population that could afford premium care services. Overall, while there are challenges such as the aging population and housing market trends, the higher GDHI per head offers a potential advantage for investors looking to establish or expand care home facilities in Warwick.
