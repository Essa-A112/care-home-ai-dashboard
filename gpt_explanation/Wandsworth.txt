The Local Authority District of Wandsworth has shown a mixed profile in terms of its care home investment potential score of 0.10. While the area boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong quality of care provision, the relatively low percentage of homes requiring improvement is a positive sign for potential investors. However, the moderate house price growth and a relatively young population with less than 10% aged 65 and over may pose challenges for the care home market in Wandsworth. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively high, which could suggest a population with greater financial capacity to afford care services. Despite these strengths, the lower proportion of older residents could limit the demand for care services, posing a potential risk to investment returns. Overall, while Wandsworth shows promise with its quality care homes and favorable income levels, investors should carefully consider the demographic factors that may impact the demand for care services in the area.
