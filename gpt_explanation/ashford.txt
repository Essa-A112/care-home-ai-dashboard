The Local Authority District of Ashford has an estimated care home investment potential score of -1.78, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Ashford exhibits a negative house price growth percentage, indicating a potential lack of real estate market stability. Additionally, a high percentage of care homes in the area are rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which suggests challenges in the quality of care provision. The relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care home services. However, one positive aspect is the presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as outstanding by the CQC.

Given these factors, Ashford is not currently suitable for care home investment. The combination of negative house price growth, a high proportion of care homes requiring improvement, and a lower percentage of the elderly population may pose risks to potential investors. Improvement in these areas, particularly in enhancing care quality and attracting more elderly residents, could potentially make Ashford a more viable investment option in the future.
