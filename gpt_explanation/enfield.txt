The Local Authority District of Enfield has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.08, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. Several key factors contribute to this rating. Enfield exhibits a relatively low House Price Growth percentage and a smaller proportion of individuals aged 65 and above, both impacting its desirability for care home investment. Additionally, the number of Care Homes per 10,000 residents and the total population size further diminish its appeal for potential investors. On a positive note, the district boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, indicating a standard of quality in existing facilities. Overall, Enfield's current profile suggests that it may not be conducive to immediate investment in the care home sector. Further improvements in various aspects could potentially position it for consideration in the future.
