The investment potential score for Enfield, with a value of 32.82, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investment. Several key factors contribute to this classification. Enfield exhibits a negative house price growth percentage of -5.53, indicating a potential lack of growth in property values. While the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is relatively low at 19.75%, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 77.78% suggests a saturated market with limited room for improvement. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 14.32% may indicate a smaller target demographic for care home services. Although there are no inadequate-rated care homes in the area, the overall profile suggests limited growth potential for care home investments in Enfield. Therefore, based on the current data, Enfield is deemed unsuitable for investment in the care home sector.
