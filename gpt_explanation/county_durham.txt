The Local Authority District of County Durham has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -4.84, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of a significant House Price Growth decrease of -24.72% suggests a challenging economic environment for potential investment returns. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (9.21%) and limited number of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (82.24%) indicate potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. The large total population of 532,182 residents may present both opportunities and challenges in terms of demand for care services. On a positive note, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is relatively low at 21.7%, suggesting potential for growth in the elderly population segment. Overall, given the overall negative impact of key indicators, County Durham is not currently recommended for care home investment. Further improvements in housing market conditions and care home quality ratings could potentially change this assessment in the future.
