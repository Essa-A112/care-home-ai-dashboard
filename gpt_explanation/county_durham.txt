The Local Authority District of County Durham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 20.62, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 21.7%, indicating a potential demand for care services. However, the district faces challenges such as a significant decrease in house price growth by -29.23%, potentially affecting property investment returns. Additionally, a notable proportion of care facilities in the area require improvement according to CQC ratings, with only 82.24% rated as "Good". The total population figure of 532,182 also impacts the score negatively. Considering these factors, County Durham may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the overall lower score and the need for improvements in certain areas. Further assessment and enhancements in housing market performance and care quality could potentially elevate its investment potential in the future.
