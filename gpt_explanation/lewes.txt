The Local Authority District of Lewes has shown promising investment potential with an estimated score of 11.67, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is primarily influenced by several positive factors, including strong house price growth, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement by CQC standards, a significant proportion of the population being over 65 years old, a decent Gross Disposable Household Income per capita, and a lack of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by CQC. These factors indicate a favorable environment for care home investment in Lewes. However, there are still areas for improvement, such as enhancing the quality of existing care facilities and potentially expanding services to meet the needs of an aging population. Overall, Lewes presents a viable option for investment, especially with strategic enhancements to capitalize on its existing strengths and address any weaknesses to further boost its attractiveness to investors.
