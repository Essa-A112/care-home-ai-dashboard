The Local Authority District of Lewes has an estimated care home investment potential score of 44.42, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. With a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC standards at 24.0%, and a strong house price growth rate of 10.97%, Lewes shows promising indicators for investment. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is at 26.94%, suggesting a potentially high demand for care services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC at 76.0% may indicate a competitive market or potential saturation. The absence of care homes rated as "Outstanding" could also be a point for improvement. Overall, while Lewes shows potential for care home investment, further enhancements in quality and differentiation may be necessary to fully capitalize on this potential. Thus, it falls into the category of being considered for investment after improvements.
