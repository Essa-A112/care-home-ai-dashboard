Basildon received a care home investment potential score of 4.71, indicating moderate potential in this sector. The relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 71.43% is a strength, suggesting a good quality of care provision within the district. However, the low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 8.57% could be seen as a weakness, indicating room for improvement in terms of exceptional care services. The low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 17.08% might pose a challenge for the care home market, as a higher elderly population typically drives demand for such facilities. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth and the number of care homes per 10,000 population could be seen as risks, potentially affecting the affordability and market saturation within the care home sector in Basildon.
