Basildon, as indicated by its care home investment potential score of 4.71, falls into the "Avoid" category for investment. This score suggests that the area may not be currently ideal for care home investment. Several factors contribute to this assessment. Basildon shows a moderate house price growth rate, which could potentially limit the return on investment. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively low, indicating a potentially smaller market for care home services. The number of care homes per 10,000 residents is also on the lower side, suggesting possible oversaturation or limited demand in the area. While a significant percentage of care homes have been rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the proportion of "Outstanding" facilities is relatively low. Therefore, investing in Basildon at this time may not yield optimal returns. Further improvements in various aspects, such as increasing demand through demographic changes or enhancing care home quality, could potentially make Basildon a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
