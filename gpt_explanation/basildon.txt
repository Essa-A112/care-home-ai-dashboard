The Local Authority District of Basildon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.82, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Basildon shows strengths in having a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, standing at 20.0%, which has a positive impact on the score. However, weaknesses are apparent in other areas such as a high percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 17.08%, along with a lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" by the CQC. Additionally, the modest house price growth rate of 6.77% contributes negatively to the overall score. Considering these factors, Basildon may not be suitable for immediate investment due to its score falling below the recommended threshold. Improvement in areas like CQC ratings and demographic factors could potentially elevate its investment potential in the future.
