East Hertfordshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.37, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 92.31% is a strength, indicating a good standard of care provision. However, the presence of care homes requiring improvement at 7.69% and the lack of 'Outstanding' or 'Inadequate' rated homes suggest room for enhancement. Additionally, the negative house price growth of -0.33% indicates potential economic challenges within the district. Considering these factors, East Hertfordshire falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Improvement initiatives could potentially shift its status to a consideration for investment in the future.
