East Hertfordshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.47, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This low score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the area boasts a high percentage of care homes with 'Good' CQC ratings at 92.31%, other indicators such as a negative house price growth rate, a notable proportion of residents aged 65 and over, and a small percentage of care homes requiring improvement all contribute to the lower investment potential. However, the positive impact of a relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 provides a slight offset to the negative factors. Overall, the current state of East Hertfordshire suggests that it may not be a favorable location for care home investment at this time due to the combination of unfavorable indicators.
