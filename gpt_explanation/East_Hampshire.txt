The Local Authority District of East Hampshire has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care home services in the area. This demographic trend is a key strength driving its care home investment potential score. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission is a weakness that could impact the overall quality of care available in the district. Additionally, while the house price growth in East Hampshire is positive, it may pose a challenge for affordability and accessibility of care services for the elderly population. On a positive note, the high percentage of care homes with good CQC ratings reflects a level of quality already present in the district. Overall, while there is a solid foundation for care home investment in East Hampshire, potential investors should consider addressing the existing care quality issues and ensuring affordability for residents amidst rising property prices.
