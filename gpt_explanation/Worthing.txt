The Local Authority District of Worthing has a compelling care home investment potential score of 9.10, primarily driven by its robust House Price Growth rate of 13.50%, indicating a strong real estate market. The relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 18.39% suggests a generally decent quality of care homes, although the high percentage of CQC Good at 79.31% could indicate potential saturation in the market. The significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 22.8% highlights a growing demographic in need of care services, boosting the demand for care homes. Moreover, with a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 population, there is a solid infrastructure in place to cater to the aging population. However, the high concentration of care homes could lead to increased competition and potential challenges in standing out. Overall, Worthing presents a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, but investors should carefully consider market saturation and competitive dynamics.
