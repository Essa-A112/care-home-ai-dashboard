The Local Authority District of Medway has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.81, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features: a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, a moderate percentage of homes with a "Good" rating, and a small percentage with an "Inadequate" or "Outstanding" rating. However, Medway's negative house price growth percentage poses a challenge to potential investment returns. While the district shows promise with its favorable CQC ratings, the declining house prices may impact the overall investment attractiveness. Therefore, Medway falls within the category that may be considered for investment after improvements are made to address the housing market challenges.
