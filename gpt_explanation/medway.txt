Medway's care home investment potential score of 6.75 places it in the "Consider" category, indicating potential for investment after improvements. The district shows strengths in the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), along with relatively low rates of homes requiring improvement or rated as inadequate. However, challenges lie in the negative impact of house price growth and the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and above. These factors suggest a mixed outlook for care home investment in Medway. While the district may benefit from enhancements to address housing market trends and cater to a growing elderly population, it currently falls short of being a top investment choice. Therefore, with strategic improvements, Medway could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
