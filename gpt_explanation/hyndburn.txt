The Local Authority District of Hyndburn has shown promising indicators for care home investment, with an estimated potential score of 11.07 placing it in the "Consider" category. The district's above-average House Price Growth of 19.48% and a relatively high percentage of CQC rated 'Good' homes at 65.85% highlight positive aspects for investment. Additionally, a moderate percentage of homes requiring improvement (24.39%) suggests opportunities for enhancement. However, challenges exist with a lower GDHI per head of 15780, which could impact investment attractiveness. The risk of inadequate care homes, though relatively low at 4.88%, should be monitored. Overall, Hyndburn falls within the threshold for consideration post-improvements, as it exhibits a mix of strengths and weaknesses. With further enhancements, it could potentially become a more favorable investment option.
