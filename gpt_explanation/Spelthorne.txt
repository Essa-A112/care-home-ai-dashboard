The Local Authority District of Spelthorne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.39, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for care home investments. The positive impact from a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes suggests a strong quality of care provision within the district. However, this positive aspect is somewhat offset by a notable decrease in house price growth, indicating potential economic challenges. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Outstanding' homes may suggest room for improvement in certain care facilities. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and over also has a negative impact, potentially signaling increased demand for care services in the future. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the overall investment potential in Spelthorne, taking into account both the strengths and weaknesses of the care home market in the area.
