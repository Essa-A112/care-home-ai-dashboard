The Local Authority District of Lancaster has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.57, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key features. Lancaster benefits from a robust House Price Growth of 15.6%, indicating a positive trend in property value. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 18.0% suggests a higher quality of care provision. However, challenges arise from a lower GDHI per head at 18434, potentially impacting the financial viability of care home investments. The aging population, with 20.52% aged 65 and over, presents both a demand for care services and strain on resources. Overall, while Lancaster shows promise with strengths in property value growth and a lower rate of care quality issues, its lower GDHI and aging population present risks. Therefore, it falls into the 'Consider' category, suggesting that with strategic improvements, it could become a more viable investment option.
