The Local Authority District of Mole Valley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.51, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Mole Valley benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, indicating a higher quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population being over 65 suggests a potential demand for care services. However, challenges include a lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission and a moderate house price growth rate. Despite these factors, the district's relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents is a positive indicator for potential investment. Overall, Mole Valley falls within the range where consideration for investment is warranted, as there are strengths to leverage but also areas that may require improvement to maximize returns.
