The Local Authority District of Mole Valley has a promising estimated care home investment potential score of 8.98, primarily due to several key factors. With a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 24.3%, Mole Valley presents a potential advantage in terms of care home demand compared to areas with higher elderly populations. Furthermore, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 75.68% indicates a strong existing care infrastructure. However, the moderate percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 21.62% suggests some room for enhancement in the overall quality of care services. The positive impact of Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head at Â£35,330 highlights the economic strength of the area, potentially indicating an ability for residents to afford higher-quality care services. On the flip side, the modest house price growth rate of 2.51% could pose a challenge for prospective investors looking for rapid appreciation in property values. Despite these considerations, Mole Valley appears to offer a solid foundation for care home investment, with opportunities for growth and improvement in the sector.
