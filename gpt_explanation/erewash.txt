The investment potential score for Erewash, with a value of 46.30, positions it within the "Consider" category. This district exhibits a mix of positive and negative indicators influencing its score. Erewash stands out positively with a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, at 29.73%. Additionally, the robust house price growth of 14.89% suggests a favorable economic environment for potential investments. On the flip side, the high proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC, at 70.27%, could indicate a saturated market with limited room for growth. Notably, the absence of any inadequate or outstanding CQC ratings may imply a stable but potentially competitive care home landscape in Erewash. Given its score falling just below the investment threshold, Erewash could be a viable investment option with some enhancements to address existing challenges and capitalize on its strengths.
