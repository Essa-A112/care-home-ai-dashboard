The Local Authority District of Kirklees has a moderate care home investment potential score of 4.72, influenced by various key features. Its relatively low House Price Growth percentage suggests a stable housing market, potentially indicating affordable property prices for care home development. The high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care facilities is a strength, indicating a strong existing care home infrastructure. However, the higher percentage of residents aged 65 and over could strain future care demands. The GDHI per head value being lower might impact the ability of residents to afford premium care services. The presence of a notable percentage of CQC-rated 'Requires Improvement' facilities highlights areas that may require investment to enhance care quality. Overall, Kirklees presents a balanced investment opportunity with strengths in existing care quality but potential risks in aging population demographics and economic factors.
