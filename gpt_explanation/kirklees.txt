The investment potential score for Kirklees, with a value of 36.16, places it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, at 20.31%, is a strength for the area. However, Kirklees faces challenges such as a negative house price growth rate of -3.22%, a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 74.22%, and a significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and over, standing at 18.05% of the population. With a total population of 442,033, the area may struggle to meet the demand for care services. Given these factors, investing in Kirklees may not be advisable at this time due to the overall lower investment potential score. Further improvements in key areas could potentially make it a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
