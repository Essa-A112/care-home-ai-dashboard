The investment potential score for Kirklees, with a value of 4.72, places it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The percentage of households with residents aged 65 and over is relatively low at 18.05%, impacting the potential demand for care homes in the area. Additionally, the growth in house prices is modest, indicating potential challenges in attracting investment returns. The GDHI per head in 2022 is also on the lower side, further reflecting economic considerations. On a positive note, a significant proportion of care homes in Kirklees are rated as "Good" by CQC, which may indicate a decent standard of care provision in the region. However, the percentage of establishments requiring improvement is also notable. Overall, given the current conditions and indicators, Kirklees may not be the most suitable location for care home investment at this time. Further improvements in economic indicators and demographic factors could enhance its investment potential in the future.
