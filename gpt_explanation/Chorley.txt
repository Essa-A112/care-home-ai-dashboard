The Local Authority District of Chorley has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 9.47, largely attributed to several key features. The positive house price growth percentage indicates a healthy housing market, which can attract investment. Additionally, the significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and over suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. The low percentage of inadequate CQC ratings and a notable proportion of outstanding ratings further enhance the perceived quality of care homes in Chorley. However, the relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 population could pose a challenge in meeting the potential demand for care services. It is essential for investors to consider expanding the care home infrastructure to capitalize on the growing demographic of elderly residents. Overall, Chorley presents a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, but strategies should be in place to address the potential shortfall in care home availability.
