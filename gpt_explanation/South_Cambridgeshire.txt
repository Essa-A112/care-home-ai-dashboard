The Local Authority District of South Cambridgeshire has a relatively low estimated care home investment potential score of 0.02, primarily due to several key features that negatively impact this rating. The significant percentage of care homes categorized as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 84.85% suggests a lower potential for improvement, which could deter investors looking for opportunities with higher growth potential. Additionally, the low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 15.15% indicates a lack of top-performing facilities that could attract premium investments. The relatively low house price growth and the modest percentage of the population aged 65 and over further suggest a potentially limited demand for care home services in the area. While these factors indicate challenges for investment in care homes in South Cambridgeshire, they also present opportunities for improvement and development to enhance the area's attractiveness to investors and potentially increase its investment potential score in the future.
