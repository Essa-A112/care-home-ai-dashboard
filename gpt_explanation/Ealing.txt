The Local Authority District of Ealing has received an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.19, reflecting a mix of positive and negative factors. The district's relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 75% is a strength, indicating a strong track record in providing quality care services. However, the negative impact of a declining house price growth rate and a higher percentage of the population aged 65 and over suggest potential challenges in attracting investment. With a total population of 375,340, there may be an increased demand for care services, but the need for improvement in a quarter of the CQC-rated facilities could pose risks to potential investors. Overall, Ealing presents a balanced investment opportunity with room for growth but also requiring careful consideration of the existing challenges within the care home sector.
