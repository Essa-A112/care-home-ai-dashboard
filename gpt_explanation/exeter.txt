The Local Authority District of Exeter has an estimated care home investment potential score of -1.06, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors: a low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission, combined with a notable proportion of homes needing improvement. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents over the age of 65 and modest house price growth contribute to the overall negative outlook. These factors collectively suggest a challenging environment for care home investments in Exeter. Given the score falls below the threshold for consideration, this LAD is not recommended for investment at present.
