The investment potential score of -1.06 for the Exeter Local Authority District suggests a less favorable outlook for care home investments. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) indicates potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. Moreover, the modest house price growth and a lower proportion of individuals aged 65 and above may signal a less robust demand for care services in the area. While a younger population can mean fewer immediate care needs, it also implies a potentially smaller market for elderly care services. These factors collectively point towards potential challenges in achieving strong returns on care home investments in Exeter. Investors should be cautious and consider these aspects when evaluating opportunities in the local care home market.
