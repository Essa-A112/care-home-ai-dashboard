Exeter, as identified by its care home investment potential score of 22.94, falls into the 'Avoid' category for investment. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key factors. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission, coupled with a notable proportion of homes requiring improvement, suggests a potential quality issue within the care home sector in this area. Additionally, the negative house price growth and a relatively small percentage of the population aged 65 and over could indicate a lack of demand for care home services in the near future. These factors collectively contribute to the lower investment potential score. Given these considerations, it is recommended that investing in care homes in Exeter be approached with caution due to the existing challenges and risks associated with the current market conditions.
