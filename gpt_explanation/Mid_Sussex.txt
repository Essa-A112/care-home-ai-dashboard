Mid Sussex has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.00, reflecting a mixed picture for potential investors. The district benefits from a solid house price growth rate of 10.32%, indicating a positive economic environment for real estate investments. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 20.8% suggests a potentially growing market for care home facilities in the future. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 9.43% raises concerns about the quality of existing facilities. Furthermore, the dominance of care homes rated as good or outstanding by CQC at 86.79% may limit room for new entrants to differentiate themselves in the market. Investors should carefully consider these factors when evaluating the attractiveness of care home investments in Mid Sussex.
