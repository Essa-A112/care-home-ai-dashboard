The Local Authority District of Bassetlaw has a strong investment potential score of 17.21, primarily driven by several key positive indicators. The significant house price growth of 36.17% suggests a thriving property market, making it an attractive location for investment. The high percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 62.5% reflects positively on the quality of care facilities in the area.
