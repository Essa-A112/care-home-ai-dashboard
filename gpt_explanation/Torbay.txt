Torbay, based on its investment profile and a high care home investment potential score of 9.17, demonstrates several key strengths that contribute to its attractiveness for care home investments. The district boasts a robust house price growth rate of 11.10%, indicating a healthy property market that could drive returns for investors. Moreover, with 27.18% of its population aged 65 and over and a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 6.74, Torbay shows a significant demand for elderly care services. However, there are potential weaknesses to consider, such as the percentage of care homes requiring improvement standing at 19.35%, which may indicate challenges in the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, the GDHI per head in 2022 is comparatively lower at 19990, suggesting potential affordability issues for residents seeking care services. Despite these drawbacks, Torbay's strong market fundamentals and high demand for care homes present notable opportunities for investors, although mitigating risks related to care home quality and financial accessibility will be crucial for long-term success in this market.
