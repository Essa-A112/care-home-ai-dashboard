The Local Authority District of South Hams has a promising care home investment potential score of 13.73, driven by several key factors. With a robust house price growth of 12.52%, it signifies a healthy real estate market that could attract investment. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 29.41% suggests a higher quality of care homes within the district. The significant population of individuals aged 65 and above at 28.75% indicates a potential demand for care services. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head of Â£26,872 highlights a financially stable demographic that may afford premium care services. While South Hams lacks any CQC outstanding rated care homes, there is room for improvement to enhance the overall quality and reputation of care facilities. One potential risk to consider could be the need for continual investment in care infrastructure and services to meet the growing demand from an aging population. However, with its positive indicators and potential for growth, South Hams presents an attractive opportunity for investors in the care home sector.
