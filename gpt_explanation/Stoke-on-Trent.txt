Stoke-on-Trent, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.79, showcases a mixed profile with both strengths and weaknesses influencing its score. The district benefits from a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong existing infrastructure and quality of care. This is a positive factor contributing to its score. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement suggests areas where investment and improvement may be needed. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over could pose a challenge in terms of demand for care home services in the future. The moderate house price growth and the GDHI per head figures also indicate potential economic constraints that could impact investment opportunities in the care home sector. Overall, Stoke-on-Trent presents a nuanced landscape for care home investments, with opportunities for improvement and growth, alongside inherent risks tied to demographics and economic factors.
