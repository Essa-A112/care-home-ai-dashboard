The investment potential score for North East Lincolnshire, standing at 31.67, places it in the 'Avoid' category, indicating caution for potential investors. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of the population aged 65 and above is relatively high at 21.43%, suggesting a potential demand for care home services. However, the presence of 12.73% of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments raises concerns about the quality of existing facilities. Additionally, although there are no inadequate care homes, the relatively low percentage of outstanding care homes at 9.09% signals room for enhancement in service quality. On a different note, the moderate house price growth rate of 6.54% could offer some economic stability for investors. In summary, due to the need for improvement in care home standards and the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, North East Lincolnshire is currently deemed unsuitable for immediate investment without necessary enhancements.
