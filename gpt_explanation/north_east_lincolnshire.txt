The Local Authority District of North East Lincolnshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.10, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. While the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively high at 21.43%, indicating potential demand for care services, other metrics paint a less favorable picture. The high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings at 12.73% and a low percentage of outstanding-rated homes at 9.09% suggest quality issues within the existing care facilities. Additionally, the modest house price growth and relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 further dampen the attractiveness of this area for care home investment. Considering these factors, North East Lincolnshire may not be suitable for investment at present due to the existing challenges in care home quality and economic indicators. Further improvements in care home standards and economic conditions could potentially make this area more viable for investment in the future.
