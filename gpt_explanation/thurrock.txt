The Local Authority District of Thurrock has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.23, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for care home investments. One key factor influencing this score is the relatively low House Price Growth percentage, which may suggest a less dynamic property market. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low, potentially impacting the demand for care home services. On a positive note, the high percentage of CQC Good ratings and the relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings indicate a favorable quality of existing care homes in the area. However, the low number of Care Homes per 10,000 residents may pose a challenge in meeting potential future demand. Overall, Thurrock presents a mixed picture for care home investment, with strengths in quality ratings but weaknesses in market dynamics and supply capacity. Investors should consider these factors carefully when evaluating opportunities in this area.
