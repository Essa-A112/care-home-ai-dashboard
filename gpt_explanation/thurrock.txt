The Local Authority District of Thurrock has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.23, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Thurrock exhibits a negative house price growth rate and a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially limited demand for care home services. Additionally, the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests a saturated market or limited opportunities for expansion. On a positive note, the district boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, indicating good quality of care provision. However, the presence of a significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement raises some concerns about overall service standards. Given these factors, Thurrock is not currently deemed suitable for investment. Further assessment and potential improvements in housing market conditions and demographic trends may warrant reconsideration in the future.
