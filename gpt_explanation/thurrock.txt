The investment potential score of 32.88 for Thurrock indicates that it falls into the "Avoid" category for care home investment. Several key features contribute to this assessment. Thurrock exhibits a negative house price growth rate of -11.74%, which may signal a stagnant or declining property market. Furthermore, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low at 13.64%, potentially limiting the demand for care home services. While the proportion of care homes with a "Good" rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is high at 72.41%, the presence of a significant percentage (24.14%) requiring improvement raises concerns about overall care quality. With a below-average number of care homes per 10,000 residents, the capacity to meet potential future demand may be constrained. Given these factors, Thurrock's current profile suggests that it is not an ideal location for care home investment. Further improvements in property market performance, demographic trends, and care quality ratings may be necessary to consider this area for investment in the future.
