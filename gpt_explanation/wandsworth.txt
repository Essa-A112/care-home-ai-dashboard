The Local Authority District of Wandsworth has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.10, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission is a strength, indicating good quality of care provision. However, the low percentage of homes needing improvement suggests limited room for enhancement. The moderate house price growth and relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over may pose challenges for attracting investment. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is relatively high, which could potentially support investment in care facilities. Overall, Wandsworth falls below the threshold for investment suitability, primarily due to the low investment potential score and limited room for improvement in care home quality.
