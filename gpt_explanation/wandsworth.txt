The Local Authority District of Wandsworth has an estimated care home investment potential score of 22.99, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Wandsworth has a very low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission and no homes requiring improvement, indicating a lack of high-quality care facilities in the area. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over suggests a potentially smaller demand for care services. The modest house price growth and the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents further contribute to the lower investment potential score. Overall, Wandsworth may not be an attractive investment opportunity due to the existing weaknesses in care home quality, limited demand, and market indicators. As such, it falls below the threshold for investment suitability and may require significant improvements to become a more favorable option for investment in the future.
