Southampton's estimated care home investment potential score of 3.99 is influenced by several key factors. The relatively low House_Price_Growth_% and GDHI per head in 2022 indicate a potential weakness in the area's economic prosperity and the ability of individuals to afford higher-priced care services. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively low, suggesting a smaller immediate market for care home services. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC is a notable strength, indicating a higher quality of care provision in the area. On the flip side, the percentage of care homes that require improvement presents a risk, as it suggests areas where care standards may need enhancement. Overall, while Southampton shows strengths in care quality, the lower economic indicators and demographics may pose challenges for care home investment potential in the region.
