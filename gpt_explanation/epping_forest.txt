The Local Authority District of Epping Forest has demonstrated a moderate care home investment potential with a score of 11.50, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Epping Forest shows promising signs with a robust House Price Growth of 13.55%, a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 26.09%, and a healthy Gross Disposable Household Income per head of Â£33,619. However, the district's relatively low number of Care Homes per 10,000 population could pose a challenge for investors looking to enter the market. While the absence of CQC Outstanding ratings may suggest room for improvement, the overall positive metrics indicate potential for growth in the care home sector in Epping Forest. Investors may find this district worth considering for investment, especially with strategic enhancements to address the lower Care Homes per capita ratio and further improve care quality standards.
