The Local Authority District of King's Lynn and West Norfolk has an estimated care home investment potential score of 10.65, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score was likely influenced by several key factors. The district demonstrates strengths in its relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes and a lower proportion of homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' or 'Inadequate'. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is moderate, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, the negative house price growth may pose a challenge for investment returns. While the district shows promise, it falls slightly below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. With some improvements in house price growth and potentially addressing any areas of care quality concerns, King's Lynn and West Norfolk could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
