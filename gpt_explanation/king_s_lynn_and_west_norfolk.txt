The Local Authority District of King's Lynn and West Norfolk has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 48.30, categorizing it as "Good" for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 60.98%, indicating a strong quality of care provision. Additionally, a sizable elderly population of 26.36% aged 65 and over suggests a potential demand for care services. However, there are areas for improvement, such as the significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC at 31.71%. Moreover, a slight decline in house price growth by -0.88% may pose a challenge for investment returns. Despite these drawbacks, the overall positive indicators make King's Lynn and West Norfolk a suitable candidate for investment, especially with the opportunity to enhance care quality and address housing market dynamics to further boost its attractiveness for care home investments.
