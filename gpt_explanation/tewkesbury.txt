The Local Authority District of Tewkesbury has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.44, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Tewkesbury shows promising house price growth at 6.66%, coupled with a decent percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 22.39%. However, the district also has a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 16.67%, along with a lower percentage of CQC-rated "Good" homes at 77.78%. Despite having no inadequate-rated care homes, the need for improvement and the lower proportion of top-rated facilities may pose risks for potential investors. Given its current score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, Tewkesbury is recommended to be avoided for care home investments at this time.
