The Local Authority District of Tewkesbury has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.24, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This is primarily due to a combination of factors impacting its suitability for investment. Tewkesbury shows a moderate house price growth percentage, which may not offer substantial returns for investors. The relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests potential saturation in the market. Additionally, a notable percentage of care facilities requiring improvement according to CQC assessments could pose risks for investors seeking high-quality care home opportunities. However, the district's high proportion of residents aged 65 and over could indicate a demand for care services in the future. Overall, given the current data, Tewkesbury does not present an attractive investment opportunity in the care home sector and may require significant improvements to become more favorable for potential investors.
