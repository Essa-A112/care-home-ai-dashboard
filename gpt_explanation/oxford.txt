The Local Authority District of Oxford has a concerning estimated care home investment potential score of -3.63. Several key features contribute to this low score. Firstly, the significant negative House_Price_Growth_% suggests a challenging economic environment for potential care home investments. Additionally, the high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the CQC indicates potential quality issues within the existing care facilities. The relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and over in the population may signal a limited demand for care services. However, the absence of any care homes rated as outstanding by the CQC could present an opportunity for investors to improve and differentiate their facilities in the market. Overall, Oxford's investment potential in the care home sector seems hindered by economic conditions, quality concerns, and potentially limited demand, highlighting the need for careful consideration of risks and opportunities in this particular market.
