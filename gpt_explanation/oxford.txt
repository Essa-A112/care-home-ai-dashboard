The Local Authority District of Oxford has been assessed to have an estimated care home investment potential score of -3.63, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This rating is primarily influenced by several key factors, such as a significant decline in House Price Growth percentage, a high percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission, and a relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and above. While the absence of care homes rated as outstanding is a positive aspect, the overall negative impact of these factors outweighs it. Given the combination of these features, Oxford is deemed unsuitable for investment at present. It may benefit from improvements in various areas to potentially become a more viable option in the future.
