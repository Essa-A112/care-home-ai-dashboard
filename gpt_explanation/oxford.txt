The Local Authority District of Oxford has received a care home investment potential score of 21.48, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. Several key factors contribute to this classification. Oxford exhibits a negative house price growth percentage of -23.62, indicating a potential lack of growth in property values. Additionally, a notable portion of care homes in the area require improvement, with 11.76% falling into this category. The percentage of residents aged 65 and over is relatively low at 12.0%, potentially impacting the demand for care home services. While a high percentage of care homes are rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 88.24%, the overall low number of care homes per 10,000 residents further deters investment potential. Given these factors, Oxford is currently deemed unsuitable for investment, with improvements needed to enhance its attractiveness for care home investments.
