The investment potential score of 0.76 for Blackburn with Darwen indicates a moderately favorable environment for care home investments. The district benefits from a relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" and a lower proportion that "Requires Improvement," suggesting a generally positive quality of care provision. However, challenges arise from a declining house price growth rate, which may impact property value appreciation for potential investors. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above could limit the immediate demand for care home services. The GDHI per head being on the lower end may also suggest potential financial constraints within the community that could affect the affordability of care services. Overall, while Blackburn with Darwen presents strengths in care home quality, there are notable weaknesses in economic indicators and demographic factors that investors should consider when evaluating opportunities in the area.
