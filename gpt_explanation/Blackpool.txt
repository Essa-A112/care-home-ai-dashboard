The investment potential score of 6.28 for Blackpool suggests a moderately appealing opportunity for care home investment. The relatively high percentage of CQC ratings indicating Good quality (68.12%) and a lower proportion requiring improvement (23.19%) are positive indicators of the overall care standards in the area. However, the lower GDHI per head in 2022 and a smaller percentage of CQC ratings marked as Outstanding (8.7%) may pose challenges in terms of potential profitability and premium services. The negative impact of house price growth could be a concern for investors looking for rapid appreciation in property values. Despite these weaknesses, Blackpool's solid core of Good-rated care homes presents a stable foundation for investment with potential for growth, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to areas with higher economic indicators. Investors should be mindful of these factors and consider a balanced approach to mitigate risks while capitalizing on the strengths of the market.
