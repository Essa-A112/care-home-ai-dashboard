The Local Authority District of Charnwood has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 46.38, positioning it within the 'Consider' category. This score reflects a mixed profile for care home investment. Charnwood demonstrates strengths in its House Price Growth percentage of 28.73%, indicating a positive market trend for property values. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement at 20.69% suggests a proactive approach to maintaining care standards. However, the high proportion of CQC Good ratings at 75.86% may indicate saturation in the market or potential challenges in standing out among competitors.
