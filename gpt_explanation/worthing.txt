The Local Authority District of Worthing has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 9.10, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district's positive attributes include a strong House_Price_Growth of 13.50%, a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 22.8%, and a healthy number of Care_Homes per 10,000 residents. However, Worthing faces challenges with a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 18.39%, and a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 79.31%. While the district's overall score suggests potential, improvements in CQC ratings could further enhance its attractiveness for investment. Therefore, Worthing falls within the range where consideration for investment after certain enhancements may be warranted, rather than an immediate investment opportunity.
