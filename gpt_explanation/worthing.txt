The Local Authority District of Worthing has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.60, placing it in the "Consider" category. Worthing exhibits strengths in terms of a positive house price growth percentage of 12.05% and a relatively low percentage of inadequate CQC ratings at 0.0%. Additionally, with 22.8% of its population being 65 years old or above and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents, there is a solid foundation for investment potential. However, Worthing's high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 79.31% may have contributed to its score falling slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability. While the district shows promise, it may benefit from some improvements to further enhance its attractiveness for care home investments. By addressing areas such as increasing the number of care homes or diversifying care services, Worthing could potentially move into the investment-ready category in the future.
