The Local Authority District of Hillingdon has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.56, categorizing it in the "Avoid" category. This classification is primarily influenced by several key factors. Hillingdon exhibits a slight decline in House Price Growth, which could deter potential investors seeking robust returns. Moreover, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC is moderately high at 6.67%, indicating a need for enhancements in the quality of care services. Despite a substantial proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC at 90%, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 13.33% may limit the demand for care services in the area. However, a positive aspect is the low percentage of care homes rated as "Inadequate" at 3.33%, suggesting a generally satisfactory standard of care provision. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, Hillingdon is currently deemed unsuitable for care home investment. Further improvements in house price growth and the quality of care services may enhance its investment potential in the future.
