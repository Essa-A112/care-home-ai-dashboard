The Local Authority District of Hillingdon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 24.90, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This determination is influenced by several key factors. Hillingdon exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), potentially indicating challenges in maintaining high-quality care standards. Additionally, the negative house price growth and a smaller proportion of residents aged 65 and above suggest a less favorable environment for care home investment. Although the absence of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' provides a slight positive influence, the overall profile suggests that Hillingdon may not currently offer the most conducive conditions for successful care home investment. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution and avoid investing in this particular area at present.
