The Local Authority District of Croydon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.06, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. Several key factors contribute to this rating. While Croydon boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, the area faces challenges such as a relatively low house price growth rate and a significant portion of the population requiring improvement in care services. Additionally, with a relatively small percentage of residents aged 65 and over compared to other areas, the demand for care homes may not be as strong. Given these factors, Croydon may not be the most promising location for care home investment at present.
