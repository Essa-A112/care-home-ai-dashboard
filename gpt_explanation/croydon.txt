The Local Authority District of Croydon has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.06, which indicates a relatively lower potential for care home investments. This score could be attributed to several key features of the area. While Croydon boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, the negative impact of factors such as a moderate house price growth rate, a notable proportion of the population aged 65 and over, and a large total population size have likely contributed to the lower investment potential score. These factors suggest that Croydon may face challenges in terms of affordability and potential saturation of care home services due to the aging population and high population density. Investors may need to carefully consider these aspects along with the existing strengths of the area when evaluating investment opportunities in the care home sector in Croydon.
