The Local Authority District of Huntingdonshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.16, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows a negative impact on house price growth, percentage of care homes requiring improvement, and the number of care homes per 10,000 residents. While it has a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, this positive aspect is outweighed by its low Gross Disposable Household Income per head. Overall, these factors indicate a challenging environment for care home investment in Huntingdonshire. Given its score falling below the threshold for consideration, it is recommended that investors exercise caution and avoid investing in care homes in this district at the current time.
