Huntingdonshire's estimated care home investment potential score of 33.83 places it in the "Avoid" category. This rating is influenced by several key factors. The district has a relatively low percentage of care homes with "Good" ratings by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 80.65%, while the percentage requiring improvement stands at 16.13%. Additionally, despite a positive impact from the percentage of residents aged 65 and above, the overall number of care homes per 10,000 residents is on the lower side. These factors collectively suggest a mixed picture for care home investment in Huntingdonshire, with room for improvement in care quality and potential capacity issues. As such, this district is currently deemed unsuitable for investment, highlighting the need for enhancements in care home standards and infrastructure before considering investment opportunities.
