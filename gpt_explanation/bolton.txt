The Local Authority District of Bolton has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.96, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score suggests that while there are opportunities for investment, there are also areas that may benefit from improvement. Bolton exhibits positive house price growth, indicating a potentially favorable market environment. However, the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above could pose a challenge in terms of demand for care services. Additionally, the presence of a significant portion of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with moderate GDHI per head and a relatively low percentage of outstanding CQC ratings, indicates areas for enhancement in care home quality. Considering these factors, Bolton may be a candidate for investment after targeted improvements to address the identified weaknesses and risks, thereby maximizing its potential for successful care home investments.
