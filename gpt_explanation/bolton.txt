The Local Authority District of Bolton has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.72, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment at present. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC data, which is a strength. However, the lower house price growth, a smaller percentage of the population aged 65 and over, and a higher percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by CQC all contribute negatively to the overall score. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is below average, further impacting the investment potential. Given these factors, Bolton may not currently offer a favorable environment for care home investment. It may be beneficial to explore opportunities for improvement in these areas before considering investment in the district.
