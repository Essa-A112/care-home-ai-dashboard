The Local Authority District of Haringey has an estimated care home investment potential score of 22.44, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. Haringey has a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission, with only 8.33% meeting the standards. Additionally, the district has seen a negative house price growth of -17.27%, which may indicate economic challenges. Despite a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 91.67%, the overall environment may not be conducive for investment due to a relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and over at 11.08% and a below-average number of care homes per 10,000 population at 0.9129. Given these factors, Haringey is not currently suitable for investment and may require significant improvements before consideration for investment opportunities.
