The investment potential score for Haringey, with a value of -0.36, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Notably, the negative house price growth and the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated good care homes, indicate potential challenges in the local care home market. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care home services in the area. On a positive note, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is relatively high, which could suggest some capacity for private pay care. Considering these factors collectively, investing in care homes in Haringey may not be advisable at this time due to the overall unfavorable conditions and potential risks associated with the market dynamics in the area.
