The investment potential score for Mid Sussex is 35.03, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On a positive note, the area exhibits a healthy house price growth rate of 10.83%, which can be an indicator of economic stability. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 20.8%, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, Mid Sussex faces challenges, with a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement (9.43%) and a low percentage of outstanding-rated care homes (9.43%). These factors indicate a mixed landscape for care home investments in the region. Given the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised. Further improvements in care home quality and regulatory ratings could potentially enhance the investment appeal of Mid Sussex in the future.
