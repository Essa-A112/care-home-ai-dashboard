The Local Authority District of Mid Sussex has received an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.00, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Mid Sussex has a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" or "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission, indicating potential quality concerns. Additionally, a notable proportion of care homes in the area require improvement according to CQC assessments. On a positive note, the district benefits from a growing housing market, with a solid house price growth rate. Moreover, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is moderate, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, the overall score suggests that, at present, Mid Sussex may not be an ideal location for care home investment. Improvement efforts in the quality of existing care facilities could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
