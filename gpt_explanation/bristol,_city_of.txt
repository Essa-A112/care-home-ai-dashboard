The Local Authority District of Bristol, City of, has an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.95, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district has a relatively low percentage of properties rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, coupled with a notable proportion requiring improvement. Additionally, the population demographics skew towards a younger age group, potentially indicating lower demand for care homes. The moderate house price growth rate and the total population size further contribute to the negative score. Overall, these factors suggest that Bristol, City of, may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in care quality ratings and demographic shifts towards an older population could potentially make it a more viable investment option in the future.
