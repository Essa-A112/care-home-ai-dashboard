The investment potential score for the Sevenoaks Local Authority District is 35.19, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Sevenoaks shows a relatively low percentage of CQC Outstanding care homes at 12.9%, indicating room for improvement in the quality of existing care facilities. However, the district has a high percentage of CQC Good rated care homes at 70.97%, which is a strength suggesting a decent standard of care provision. The percentage of CQC Requires Improvement homes is 16.13%, posing a moderate risk to potential investors. Additionally, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over is 22.15%, indicating a growing market for care services. The GDHI per head in 2022 is Â£33,984, a positive sign for potential investment returns. Despite these strengths, the overall score suggests that Sevenoaks may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at present, as improvements are needed to enhance the quality of care services in the area.
