The Local Authority District of Sevenoaks has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.91, categorizing it as an area to be avoided for investment at present. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Sevenoaks boasts a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 70.97% and a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 22.15%. Additionally, the GDHI per head in 2022 stands at 33,984, indicating a potentially strong economic base. However, challenges arise from a lower house price growth rate of 2.78%, signaling potential stagnation in the property market. Furthermore, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is notable at 16.13%, suggesting room for enhancement in the quality of care services. Given these factors, Sevenoaks is currently deemed unsuitable for direct investment, with potential for consideration in the future pending improvements in housing market performance and care home quality standards.
