East Staffordshire's care home investment potential score of 31.09 places it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by key factors such as a negative house price growth of -7.29% and a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 17.31%. While the area boasts a favorable number of care homes per 10,000 residents, the dominance of care homes in need of enhancement and the negative trend in house prices present significant concerns for potential investors. With a substantial portion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC, there is a foundation for improvement, but the overall profile suggests that East Staffordshire may not currently offer a strong investment opportunity. Further enhancements in care quality and housing market performance could potentially shift this LAD into a more attractive category for investment in the future.
