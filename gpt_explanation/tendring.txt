The investment potential score for Tendring, with a value of 5.58, places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Tendring has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which suggests a potential demand for care services. However, the high proportion of care homes with a "Requires Improvement" rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is a notable weakness. Additionally, the modest house price growth rate may impact the financial viability of care home investments in the area. On a positive note, Tendring has a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents, indicating some existing infrastructure. Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that while there is demand for care services, the quality and financial aspects may need improvement before considering investment.
