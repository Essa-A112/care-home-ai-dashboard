The Local Authority District of Tendring has an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.42, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key features. Tendring demonstrates strengths in its percentage of population aged 65 and over, which is at 29.62%, indicating a potentially higher demand for care services. However, the district faces challenges with a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 87.23%. Additionally, there is a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement, standing at 10.64%. These factors, combined with a modest house price growth of 0.32%, contribute to the overall score. Given the current assessment, Tendring is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. However, with potential improvements in CQC ratings and addressing the need for quality enhancements in care homes, this district may become a viable option for investment in the future.
