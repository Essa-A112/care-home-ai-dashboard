The Local Authority District of North Lincolnshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.55, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score suggests that while there are positive aspects, there are also areas that could benefit from improvement. North Lincolnshire demonstrates strengths in its relatively high percentage of Good-rated care homes at 66.67% and a significant portion of the population aged 65 and over at 22.68%. However, challenges lie in the percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 23.81% and a lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 at Â£18,195. The notable risk comes from the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as Outstanding at 9.52%. Overall, North Lincolnshire may be considered for investment after addressing the areas requiring improvement and leveraging its strengths in the care home sector.
