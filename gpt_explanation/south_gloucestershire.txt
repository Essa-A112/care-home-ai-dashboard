The Local Authority District of South Gloucestershire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.99, placing it in the Avoid category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district boasts a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 75.58%. However, this is offset by a significant percentage of care homes requiring improvement (11.63%) and a low percentage rated as 'Outstanding' (12.79%). Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 18.73% may indicate a lower demand for care home services in the area. The modest house price growth of 2.16% further dampens the investment potential. Given these factors, South Gloucestershire currently does not present a favorable environment for care home investment and falls below the threshold for consideration even with improvements.
