The district exhibits a notable percentage of the population over the age of 65, a factor generally favorable for care home investment. Moreover, with a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate and requiring improvement according to CQC assessments, there is a foundation suggesting a decent quality of care within the area.
