The Local Authority District of Cheshire West and Chester has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 8.01, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The district boasts a significant percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 69.23%, indicating a strong foundation for quality care provision. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of homes rated as 'Inadequate' at 7.69% suggests a generally positive standard of care within the area. However, the negative impact of house price growth at -1.20% may pose a challenge for potential investors. With a notable proportion of individuals aged 65 and over at 21.61%, there is a clear demand for elderly care services. While the district falls short of the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its strengths in care quality and demographic demand indicate potential for growth with targeted improvements. Therefore, Cheshire West and Chester could be a viable option for investment after strategic enhancements to address the housing market dynamics.
