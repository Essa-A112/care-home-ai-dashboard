The Local Authority District of Knowsley has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.56, driven in part by its strong house price growth rate of 37.76%. This indicates a potentially favorable economic environment for property investments. However, the relatively low percentage of CQC-rated Good care homes at 83.33% and a notable proportion requiring improvement at 13.33% suggest weaknesses in the current care home infrastructure. Additionally, the aging population with 17.31% aged 65 or over may pose challenges in meeting the future healthcare needs of the elderly residents. On a positive note, the presence of some outstanding CQC-rated care homes at 3.33% could offer opportunities for further development and improvement in the sector. It is essential for investors to carefully consider these factors to assess the risks and advantages associated with investing in care homes in Knowsley.
