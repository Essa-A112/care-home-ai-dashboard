Knowsley has been assessed with a care home investment potential score of 10.56, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The district exhibits a high house price growth percentage, indicating a buoyant property market. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is a notable weakness, suggesting room for improvement in care quality. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is moderate, potentially indicating a demand for care services. The presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the CQC is a positive aspect. Overall, while Knowsley shows promise with its strong property market growth and potential demand for care services, the need for enhancements in care quality may warrant further consideration before investment. This district falls within the category that may be considered for investment after improvements are made.
