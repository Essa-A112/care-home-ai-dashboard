The Local Authority District of Wyre Forest has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.33, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by factors such as a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings and a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and above. However, challenges exist, as reflected by a lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC and a modest rate of house price growth. While the absence of inadequate-rated care homes is a strength, the need for improvement in care home quality and the modest house price growth may pose risks to potential investors. Overall, Wyre Forest falls within the range where investment may be considered after improvements, indicating that with enhancements in certain areas, it could become more favorable for investment.
