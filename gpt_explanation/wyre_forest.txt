The Local Authority District of Wyre Forest has shown promising indicators in its care home investment potential, with an estimated score of 8.66 falling within the "Consider" category. The district's relatively low percentage of CQC-RequiresImprovement at 24.32% and a high rate of CQC-Good at 72.97% reflect a strong foundation in care quality. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above stands at 25.42%, suggesting a potentially high demand for care services. However, the moderate house price growth of 5.77% may pose challenges in terms of affordability for both residents and investors. With a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 3.58, there is room for expansion in the care home sector. While Wyre Forest shows promise, further improvements in housing affordability and potentially increasing the number of care homes could enhance its investment appeal. Overall, this district may be considered for investment after strategic improvements are made to capitalize on its strengths and address existing weaknesses.
