The Local Authority District of Wakefield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.97, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows a relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Requires Improvement," which presents an opportunity for potential improvement and investment. However, Wakefield faces challenges such as a decline in house price growth, a significant portion of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good," and a large total population, all of which have a negative impact on its investment potential. Despite these hurdles, Wakefield's GDHI per head for 2022 is moderate, suggesting some economic stability. Considering these factors, Wakefield falls within the category of being considered for investment after potential improvements are made. It presents opportunities for growth with targeted enhancements in care home quality and could become more favorable for investment in the future.
