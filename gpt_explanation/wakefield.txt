The Wakefield Local Authority District has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.16, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Wakefield's house price growth percentage is negative, indicating a potential lack of growth in the property market. Additionally, the percentage of CQC requiring improvement is relatively high at 23.96%, suggesting potential quality issues within care homes in the area. On a positive note, the percentage of CQC-rated good establishments stands at 71.88%, reflecting a significant number of well-performing care homes. However, Wakefield's GDHI per head in 2022 is lower, potentially impacting the affordability of care services. Moreover, the percentage of the population aged 65 and above is relatively low at 19.07%, which may indicate a smaller market for elderly care services. Considering these factors, Wakefield may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the overall lower investment potential score. However, with improvements in house price growth, quality of care homes, and economic indicators, it could become a more viable investment option in the future.
