The investment potential score of 19.85 for the Staffordshire Moorlands Local Authority District indicates a promising opportunity for care home investments. Several key features contribute to this score, such as the significant house price growth percentage of 11.95%, suggesting a favorable economic environment for property investments. The relatively high percentage of CQC-rated care homes requiring improvement at 48.28% presents an opportunity for investors to potentially enhance and improve existing facilities. Moreover, the substantial proportion of CQC-rated good care homes at 44.83% signals a solid foundation of quality care services in the area. The aging population, with 26.84% aged 65 and over, indicates a growing demand for senior care services. Despite the relatively low percentage of inadequate CQC-rated care homes at 6.9%, this highlights a potential area for improvement to meet quality standards.
