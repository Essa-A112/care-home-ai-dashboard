Staffordshire Moorlands has shown promising indicators for care home investment potential with an estimated score of 19.85, placing it in the "Good" category. The district's positive House Price Growth, CQC ratings, and the percentage of the population aged 65 and above all contribute to its favorable score. The relatively high percentage of CQC ratings classified as "Good" and the low percentage of "Inadequate" ratings suggest a generally well-performing care home sector. However, there is room for improvement in the percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement. Despite this, the overall profile suggests a solid foundation for investment in care homes within Staffordshire Moorlands. With a score comfortably above the threshold for investment suitability, this LAD presents a promising opportunity for potential investors looking to enter or expand in the care home market.
