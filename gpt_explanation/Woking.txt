The Local Authority District of Woking has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 4.79, influenced by several key features. The district's strong House_Price_Growth_% of 9.69% indicates a robust property market, suggesting potential for property value appreciation. However, the relatively high percentages of CQC RequiresImprovement (11.54%) and CQC Good (84.62%) ratings imply a mixed quality of care homes in the area, presenting a potential weakness for investors to consider. Additionally, a lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and above (17.02%) may impact the demand for care home services. On the positive side, the relatively high GDHI per head in 2022 at Â£29,827 signifies a potentially affluent population that could afford higher-end care services. Investors should weigh these factors carefully to assess the overall investment attractiveness of the care home sector in Woking, considering both the opportunities and risks presented by the district's profile.
