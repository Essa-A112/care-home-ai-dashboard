The Local Authority District of Wokingham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.27, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Wokingham has a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which impacts its overall score negatively. Additionally, the proportion of homes requiring improvement and the slow growth rate in house prices further contribute to the lower score. While the district has a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good," the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services in the area. Overall, Wokingham may not be suitable for immediate investment due to these factors, suggesting a need for potential improvements to enhance its attractiveness for care home investments in the future.
