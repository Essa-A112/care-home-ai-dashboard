The Local Authority District of Wokingham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.95, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. While the percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 72.34%, the presence of a significant portion of homes requiring improvement (14.89%) and a lower percentage of 'Outstanding' rated homes (10.64%) may raise concerns about overall care quality in the area. Additionally, the modest house price growth of 1.41% suggests a potentially less lucrative market for care home investments. With only 17.37% of the population aged 65 and over, there may be limited demand for care services in Wokingham. Given these factors, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering care home investments in this LAD, as further improvements in care quality and market conditions may be necessary to enhance its investment potential.
