The Local Authority District of Torbay has shown promising potential with an estimated care home investment score of 39.85, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key factors contribute to this score: a notable 9.5% House Price Growth, indicating a positive market trend; a substantial 27.18% of the population aged 65 and over, suggesting a potential demand for care services; a relatively low 19.35% of CQC-Requires Improvement rating, indicating good quality standards in most facilities; and a high density of 6.74 Care Homes per 10,000 residents, reflecting an existing infrastructure to support the sector. However, the high percentage of 76.34% CQC-Good rating may pose a challenge, potentially indicating saturation in the market. While Torbay falls short of the ideal investment threshold, it shows promise for future growth and could be considered for investment after further improvements to address potential market saturation.
