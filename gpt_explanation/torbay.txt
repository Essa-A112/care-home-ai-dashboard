The Local Authority District of Torbay has shown promising signs for care home investment with an estimated potential score of 9.17, placing it in the "Consider" category. Torbay exhibits strengths in key areas such as house price growth, percentage of population aged 65 and over, and the number of care homes per 10,000 residents, all of which have a positive impact on its investment potential. However, there are some weaknesses to consider, including a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission and a lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022. These factors suggest that while Torbay shows promise for investment, there are areas that may require improvement to maximize returns. Therefore, Torbay may be considered for investment after necessary enhancements are made to address the identified weaknesses and mitigate associated risks.
