The Local Authority District of Melton has an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.41, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Melton boasts a relatively high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 54.55%, indicating a strong quality of care provision. Additionally, with 24.14% of the population aged 65 and over, there is a significant potential demand for care services in the area. However, the negative impact of a -23.95% house price growth rate suggests a challenging economic environment that may affect property values and investment returns. While the district has room for improvement, particularly in reducing the percentage of care homes requiring improvement (27.27%), it presents a viable option for investment consideration due to its favorable demographic profile and existing care home quality. With targeted improvements, Melton could further enhance its attractiveness for care home investment.
