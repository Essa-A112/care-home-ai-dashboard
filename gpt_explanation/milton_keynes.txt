The investment potential score for Milton Keynes, standing at 33.66, places it in the 'Avoid' category for care home investment. This assessment is influenced by several key features. While the positive impact of house price growth at 8.84% is a notable strength, other factors weigh against investment suitability. The relatively low percentage of CQC Good ratings at 80.39% and the presence of 11.76% of care homes requiring improvement are concerning weaknesses. Additionally, the sizeable population of individuals aged 65 and over at 14.15% poses a challenge in meeting potential care demands. Despite a small percentage of inadequate CQC ratings at 3.92%, the overall profile suggests that Milton Keynes may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investment. Further improvements in care quality and addressing the aging population demographic could potentially shift its suitability for investment consideration in the future.
