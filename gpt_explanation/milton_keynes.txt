Milton Keynes, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.15, falls into the "Avoid" category. This low score is primarily influenced by several negative factors, including a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement, a lower proportion of individuals aged 65 and above, and a below-average number of care homes per 10,000 people. Additionally, the modest house price growth in the area further dampens its investment attractiveness. However, a positive aspect is the low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate. Overall, due to the combination of these factors, Milton Keynes is currently not deemed suitable for care home investment. Further improvements in the quality of existing care homes and an increase in the elderly population could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
