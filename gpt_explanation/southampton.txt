The investment potential score for Southampton, with a rating of 3.99, categorizes it as an area to avoid for care home investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Southampton exhibits a relatively low house price growth rate and a smaller percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, which can limit the demand for care home services. Additionally, a notable portion of care facilities in the area require improvement based on CQC assessments. On a positive note, a significant percentage of care homes in Southampton have received a "Good" rating from the CQC. However, the overall Gross Disposable Household Income per head in the region is relatively low, potentially affecting the affordability of care services. Given these factors, Southampton may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investment, as improvements in various aspects would likely be necessary to enhance its attractiveness for such investments.
