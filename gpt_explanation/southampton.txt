The investment potential score for Southampton indicates that it falls into the "Avoid" category, with a score of 34.55. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key features in the area. Southampton has a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 78.12%, potentially impacting the quality of care available. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is 13.7%, suggesting a lower demand for care services compared to areas with higher proportions of elderly residents. The level of CQC-rated care homes requiring improvement is at 17.19%, indicating room for enhancement in the existing care facilities. Moreover, the modest house price growth rate and GDHI per head further contribute to the lower investment potential score.

Given these factors, Southampton may not be considered a favorable location for care home investment at present. The combination of lower demand for care services, existing care home quality challenges, and economic indicators suggests that significant improvements would be necessary to make this area more attractive for investment. Unless substantial enhancements are made to address these weaknesses, investing in care homes in Southampton may not yield optimal returns compared to other areas with more favorable demographics and market conditions.
