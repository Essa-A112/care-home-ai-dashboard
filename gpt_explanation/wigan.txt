The Local Authority District of Wigan has received a care home investment potential score of -0.30, indicating a less favorable outlook in this area. This assessment is likely influenced by several key features of the district. Wigan's relatively low percentages of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" and "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, coupled with a modest house price growth rate and a relatively small proportion of the population over 65, contribute to the overall negative score. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is below average, further impacting the investment potential. While Wigan may offer stability with a high percentage of well-rated care homes and a relatively younger population, the lower GDHI per head and sluggish house price growth suggest potential challenges for care home investments in this district. Investors may need to carefully weigh the strengths and weaknesses of Wigan's demographic and economic profile to make informed investment decisions in the care home sector.
