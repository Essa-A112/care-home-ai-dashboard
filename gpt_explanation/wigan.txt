The Local Authority District of Wigan has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.30, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Wigan exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), coupled with a notable portion requiring improvement. Additionally, the modest house price growth and a lower percentage of the population aged 65 and above, along with a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head, contribute to the overall assessment. These factors collectively suggest a less favorable environment for care home investment in Wigan. As such, based on the investment potential score falling below the threshold, it is recommended to avoid investing in this area at present.
