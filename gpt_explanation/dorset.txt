The investment potential score for Dorset as a Local Authority District is 37.61, categorizing it as falling within the "Consider" range. This score is influenced by several key factors. Dorset exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Requires Improvement," indicating a favorable quality of care provision within the region. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC could pose a challenge for potential investors seeking opportunities for improvement. The significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and above in Dorset is a positive demographic indicator for potential care home investment. Additionally, the steady growth in house prices and the relatively high GDHI per capita further contribute to the investment potential. While the score suggests that Dorset may be suitable for investment after considering potential improvements, it falls slightly below the threshold for immediate investment. Investors should carefully weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the region, particularly focusing on enhancing existing care home standards to maximize investment returns in the long run.
