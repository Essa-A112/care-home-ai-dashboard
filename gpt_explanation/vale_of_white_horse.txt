The Local Authority District of Vale of White Horse has a care home investment potential score of 4.00, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for investment. The positive factors contributing to this score include a relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of 'Good' and a low percentage requiring improvement. This suggests a favorable quality of care within the district. However, the negative impact of a decrease in house price growth and a lower number of care homes per 10,000 residents are potential weaknesses that could affect investment returns. The presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' may also pose a risk in terms of competition and differentiation within the market. Overall, while there are strengths in the quality of care provided, investors should carefully consider the potential impact of house price trends and the level of competition in the care home sector within the Vale of White Horse.
