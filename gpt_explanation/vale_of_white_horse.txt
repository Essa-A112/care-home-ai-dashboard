The Local Authority District of Vale of White Horse has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.00, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key features. The negative impact of House Price Growth suggests a declining property market, potentially affecting investment returns. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission indicates a level of quality in existing facilities. On the downside, the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents may indicate limited market saturation. Overall, the score suggests that while there are strengths in care quality, the unfavorable housing market and limited availability of care homes may pose risks for potential investors. Therefore, at this stage, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in the Vale of White Horse until market conditions improve or additional analysis is conducted.
