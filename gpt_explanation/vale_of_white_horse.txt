The Vale of White Horse, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.86, falls into the "Avoid" category. This classification is influenced by several key factors. The relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (21.43%) is a notable strength, indicating potential for enhancement in care quality. However, challenges arise from a negative house price growth rate of -2.51%, which may deter investment interest. Moreover, while a majority of care homes are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the lack of any "Outstanding" ratings and the presence of no "Inadequate" ratings suggest a moderate but not exceptional standard of care provision. Overall, the score suggests that the Vale of White Horse may currently present too many investment risks to be considered suitable for immediate investment, requiring potential improvements in various aspects to enhance its attractiveness to investors.
