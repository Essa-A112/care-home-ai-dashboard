Solihull, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 30.56, falls into the "Avoid" category. The district's profile indicates strengths in a relatively low percentage of inadequate CQC ratings and a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and above, which suggests a potential demand for care services. However, weaknesses such as a high percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement and a modest house price growth rate may hinder investment attractiveness. The overall score suggests that while there are positive aspects, the district may not currently offer a favorable investment environment for care homes. With a score below the recommended threshold for investment, caution is advised until improvements are made to address the identified weaknesses and risks in the care home market within Solihull.
