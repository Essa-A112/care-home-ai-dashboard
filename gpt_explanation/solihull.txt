Solihull, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.10, falls into the "Avoid" category due to several key factors. The negative impact of house price growth and the percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement and good by the CQC contribute to its low score. However, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over and the presence of outstanding care homes are positive aspects. Despite these strengths, the overall score suggests that Solihull may not be a suitable area for immediate investment in care homes. With an investment potential score well below the threshold for consideration, further improvements in various aspects such as house price growth and CQC ratings would be needed before it could be deemed a viable investment opportunity.
