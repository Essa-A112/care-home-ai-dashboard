The estimated care home investment potential score of 2.10 for Solihull suggests a moderate outlook for investment in the care home sector within the district. The negative SHAP impact from House_Price_Growth_% and the quality ratings (%_CQC_Good and %_CQC_RequiresImprovement) indicates some challenges in the local market. The relatively lower house price growth and higher proportion of care homes requiring improvement may pose obstacles for potential investors. However, the positive impact from the percentage of the population aged 65 and over and the presence of outstanding CQC-rated care homes hint at opportunities. Solihull's growing elderly population could drive demand for care services, potentially benefiting investors. Nevertheless, the need for improvement in existing care facilities and potential competition from areas with higher quality ratings are important factors to consider when assessing investment risks and advantages in the care home sector in Solihull.
