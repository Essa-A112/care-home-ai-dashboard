Great Yarmouth has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 16.74, categorizing it as a good opportunity. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a strong house price growth of 18.08%, indicating a healthy economic environment for investments. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and over (24.63%) suggests a potential demand for care services. Moreover, with 54.29% of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC and only 2.86% rated as 'Inadequate', there is a solid foundation of quality care provision. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (40.0%) highlights a need for enhancements in certain facilities. Despite this, the overall positive indicators make Great Yarmouth a suitable candidate for investment, offering opportunities for growth and development in the care home sector.
