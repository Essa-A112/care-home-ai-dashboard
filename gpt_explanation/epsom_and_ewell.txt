The investment potential score of 2.45 for Epsom and Ewell places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential care home investments in this area. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the total population in the district is relatively high, other indicators such as the percentage of CQC Requires Improvement and CQC Good ratings, house price growth, and the proportion of residents aged 65 and over have negative impacts on the score. The low percentage of CQC Good ratings and high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement suggest potential quality issues within existing care homes. Additionally, the modest house price growth and relatively low percentage of elderly residents may limit the demand for care home services in the area. Given these factors, the current investment potential score indicates that Epsom and Ewell may not be an ideal location for care home investments at this time, and further improvements or market analysis may be necessary before considering investment opportunities in this district.
