The Local Authority District of Epsom and Ewell has an estimated care home investment potential score of 29.47, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the total population of 81,989 presents a potential market size, the high percentages of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" (8.33%) and "Good" (87.5%) by the Care Quality Commission indicate room for enhancement in care quality. Additionally, the low house price growth rate of 4.02% suggests limited potential for property value appreciation in the area. Despite a lack of inadequate-rated care homes, the overall profile indicates a need for improvement in care standards and potential challenges in achieving significant returns on investment. Therefore, Epsom and Ewell is not currently recommended for investment, as the existing conditions may pose risks and hinder profitability.
