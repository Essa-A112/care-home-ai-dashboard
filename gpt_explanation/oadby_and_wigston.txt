The Local Authority District of Oadby and Wigston has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 4.12. This score reflects a mixed profile with both positive and negative indicators impacting its overall attractiveness for care home investments. The district benefits from a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings and a high percentage of CQC Good ratings, indicating a generally favorable quality of care facilities. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above suggests a potentially strong demand for care services. On the downside, the GDHI per head is on the lower side, which could indicate limited financial resources among residents. Overall, while the district shows promise with its care home density and aging population, potential investors should be cautious of the income levels in the area which may affect affordability and demand for premium care services.
