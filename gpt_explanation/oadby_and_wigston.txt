The Local Authority District of Oadby and Wigston has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.93, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively high, indicating a decent availability of care facilities, the district's CQC ratings present a concern. With a significant portion of care homes falling under the "Requires Improvement" category and a lack of any rated as "Inadequate," there is room for enhancement in service quality. The high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" is a positive indicator but is not sufficient to offset the shortcomings. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over might suggest a lower demand for care services in the area. Considering these factors, it is advisable to avoid immediate investment in care homes in Oadby and Wigston until improvements are made to address the existing deficiencies and potentially increase the demand for care services in the district.
