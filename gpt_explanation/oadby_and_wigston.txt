The Local Authority District of Oadby and Wigston has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.12, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the district has a relatively low percentage of CQC Good-rated care homes at 83.33%, indicating a strong quality standard, it also has a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 12.5%. Additionally, the GDHI per head in 2022 is relatively low at Â£19,996, suggesting potential financial constraints. On the positive side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is 20.82%, indicating a potential demand for care services. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Therefore, investing in this LAD may not be advisable at present due to the existing weaknesses in care home quality and financial indicators. Further improvements would be necessary to consider investment in the future.
