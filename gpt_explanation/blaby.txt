The Local Authority District of Blaby has an estimated care home investment potential score of 27.33, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. On the positive side, Blaby has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potential demand for care home services. However, this is offset by several negative factors. The district has a significant percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), along with a lower house price growth rate and a high proportion of care homes rated as "Good". The absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" is a positive indicator. Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that while there may be demand for care homes in Blaby due to its aging population, the current quality of care homes and the economic environment may not be conducive to investment at this time. It is recommended that further improvements be made before considering investment in this area.
