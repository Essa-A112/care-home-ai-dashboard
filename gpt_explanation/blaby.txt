The Local Authority District of Blaby has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.77, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of house price growth, the percentage of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission, and the Gross Disposable Household Income per head all contribute to the lower score. However, the positive impact of a relatively large total population in the area is a notable strength. Overall, Blaby is not currently suitable for investment due to these factors. However, with potential improvements in the areas of house price growth, care home quality, and disposable income, Blaby may become a more viable option for investment in the future.
