The Local Authority District of Hounslow has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.28, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Hounslow exhibits a lower-than-average House Price Growth percentage and a notable percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, both of which negatively impact its investment potential. On the positive side, the district shows a significant proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, indicating a reasonable quality of care provision. However, the presence of a considerable percentage of care homes requiring improvement and a relatively low percentage of 'Outstanding' rated care homes pose risks to potential investors. Overall, Hounslow falls below the threshold for investment suitability, suggesting caution in considering this area for care home investments at present.
