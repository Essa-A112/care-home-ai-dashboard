The investment potential score of 2.93 for Hounslow indicates a moderate outlook for care home investment in the area. The relatively low House_Price_Growth_% of -9.59% suggests a potential weakness, as declining house prices may impact the overall investment attractiveness. However, the high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 60.53% and the significant proportion of CQC Requires Improvement ratings at 23.68% could be seen as strengths, indicating a mix of quality care homes in the district that may present opportunities for improvement and investment. The relatively low percentage of CQC Outstanding ratings at 10.53% signals room for growth in terms of high-performing care facilities. The presence of a notable percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 12.01% could be both a potential advantage and risk, as it indicates a demand for care services but also raises concerns about the capacity to meet future care needs. Overall, while Hounslow presents a mixed picture for care home investment, there are opportunities for enhancement and growth in the sector.
