The Local Authority District of Hounslow has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.93, categorizing it as an "Avoid" area for investment. This rating is primarily influenced by a combination of factors. Notably, the district exhibits a concerning House Price Growth percentage of -9.59%, indicating a potential lack of economic growth and stability. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 12.01% may suggest a limited demand for care home services in the area. On the positive side, Hounslow boasts a commendable percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 60.53%, which signifies a certain level of quality in existing facilities.
