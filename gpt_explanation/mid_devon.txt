The Local Authority District of Mid Devon has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.00, indicating it falls into the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Mid Devon shows positive indicators such as a healthy House Price Growth of 11.72% and a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (19.35%). Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is moderately high at 24.62%, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, there are areas for improvement as well, with a notable percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and a limited number rated as "Outstanding." These factors contribute to the overall score and suggest that while there are strengths, there is room for enhancement in care home quality within the district. Given its current standing, Mid Devon may be considered for investment after further improvements to address the CQC ratings and potentially enhance the overall attractiveness for investment.
