The Local Authority District of Basingstoke and Deane has a care home investment potential score of 3.77, indicating moderate potential for such investments. The relatively high house price growth percentage suggests a strong property market, which could potentially attract investors looking for a profitable venture. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement, coupled with a lower percentage of good and outstanding care homes, may pose challenges for investors in terms of ensuring quality care provision. Furthermore, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over is relatively low, which could impact the demand for care home services in the area. Investors considering Basingstoke and Deane should weigh these factors carefully to assess the risks and advantages associated with care home investments in this district.
