The Local Authority District of Islington has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.43, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key features. Notably, Islington exhibits a significant decline in house price growth percentage, a lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, and a lower proportion of individuals aged 65 and above. These factors collectively contribute to a less favorable investment outlook for care homes in this area. While Islington may offer certain strengths, such as a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, the overall profile suggests that significant improvements would be needed to make it a viable investment option. Given its current score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised when considering care home investments in Islington until substantial enhancements are made to its investment potential.
