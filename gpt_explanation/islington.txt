The Local Authority District of Islington has a concerning estimated care home investment potential score of -7.70, largely influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of a significant house price growth decrease of -22.84% highlights potential economic challenges within the area. Moreover, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 94.44% indicates a saturated market with limited room for improvement. The relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 9.47% could suggest a smaller target demographic for care home services. Additionally, the lack of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at only 5.56% may indicate quality issues or intense competition in the market. These factors collectively present obstacles for potential care home investments in Islington, signaling a need for careful consideration of the risks and challenges associated with such ventures in this area.
