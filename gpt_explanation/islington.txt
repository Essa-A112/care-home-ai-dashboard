The Local Authority District of Islington has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -7.70, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Islington exhibits a negative impact on house price growth, with a decrease of 22.84%, indicating potential challenges in property value appreciation. Additionally, a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 94.44% suggests limited room for improvement in care standards. The relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and over at 9.47% may indicate a smaller target demographic for care home services. Furthermore, the presence of a minimal percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 5.56% highlights a potential lack of exceptional care facilities in the area. Given these factors, Islington's current profile suggests that it is not suitable for immediate investment. The district may benefit from strategic improvements to enhance its investment potential in the future.
