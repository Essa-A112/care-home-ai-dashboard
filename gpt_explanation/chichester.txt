The Local Authority District of Chichester has a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care homes in the area. This demographic trend serves as a strength, driving the positive SHAP impact on the estimated care home investment potential score. However, the high percentage of care homes with a "Good" rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) may have a negative impact on the score, suggesting that there may be less room for improvement or expansion in the market. Additionally, the moderate house price growth rate and the proportion of care homes requiring improvement both contribute negatively to the overall score, posing potential risks for investment returns. Despite these challenges, the relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents presents an advantage in terms of market saturation and potential competition. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial for investors looking to capitalize on the care home investment potential in the Chichester area.
