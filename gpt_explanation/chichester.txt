The Local Authority District of Chichester has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.94, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Chichester's relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" at 86.0% and a notable proportion requiring improvement at 12.0% suggest potential quality concerns within the existing care home infrastructure. Additionally, the modest house price growth of 0.7% may indicate limited economic growth potential in the area. However, Chichester benefits from a higher percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 27.42%, which could suggest a demand for care services in the future. With a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents, there is a foundation for care services, but improvements in quality and market demand may be necessary for successful investments. Therefore, at its current score, Chichester is deemed unsuitable for investment, highlighting the need for enhancements to its care home sector to potentially warrant consideration for future investments.
