The Local Authority District of Gosport has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.81, indicating moderate potential in this sector. The district boasts a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which is a positive factor contributing to its score. However, Gosport does have a lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) compared to the national average, suggesting potential quality issues in the existing care facilities. Additionally, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is also higher than desirable, indicating room for enhancement in the overall standard of care services. The Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in Gosport is on the lower side, which may pose financial challenges for potential investors. Despite these drawbacks, the district does not have any care homes rated as 'Outstanding,' presenting an opportunity for investors to potentially introduce high-quality care facilities. Overall, while Gosport shows promise in the care home investment sector due to its aging population, investors should carefully consider the existing quality standards, financial limitations, and opportunities for improvement to make informed investment decisions.
