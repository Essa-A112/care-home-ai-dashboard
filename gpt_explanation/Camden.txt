The Local Authority District of Camden has demonstrated a promising care home investment potential with a score of 8.18. This score can be attributed to several key features of the area. One strength lies in the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a favorable quality of care within the district. Additionally, the relatively high Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 suggests a financially stable population that could afford care services. However, the negative impact of house price growth and the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over may pose challenges for attracting investment in the care home sector. These factors could potentially limit the demand for care services or affect the affordability of care facilities in the area. Overall, while Camden shows promise for care home investments, attention should be paid to addressing these weaknesses to fully capitalize on its investment potential.
