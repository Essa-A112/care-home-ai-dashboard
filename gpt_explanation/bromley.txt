The Local Authority District of Bromley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.44, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Bromley has a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 85.71% and a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 10.2%, indicating potential quality concerns. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is 17.9%, suggesting a higher demand for care services. On a positive note, the GDHI per head in 2022 is Â£30,888, indicating a potentially favorable economic environment for investment. However, the low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 2.04% presents a risk in terms of quality standards. Considering the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, it is recommended to exercise caution regarding care home investments in Bromley until improvements are made to address quality and capacity concerns.
