The Local Authority District of Bromley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.58, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Bromley displays a relatively low percentage of care homes per 10,000 people, indicating a potential undersupply in care home facilities. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over in the district is below the national average, suggesting a potentially smaller target demographic for care home services. While the positive house price growth is a strength, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission and the relatively low percentage rated as "Good" indicate areas for improvement in the quality of care provided. Considering these factors, Bromley may not be suitable for immediate investment in the care home sector due to the existing challenges and risks associated with the market conditions and demographic profile of the district.
