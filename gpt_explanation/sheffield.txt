The Local Authority District of Sheffield has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.26, placing it in the "Consider" category. The positive feature of a 31.42% House Price Growth indicates a potentially robust property market. However, challenges arise from the relatively high percentages of care homes requiring improvement (13.53%) and those rated as good by the Care Quality Commission (83.46%). The low percentage of outstanding-rated care homes (0.75%) suggests room for enhancement in care quality. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is 17955, impacting the overall investment potential. In conclusion, while Sheffield shows promise with its property market growth, the need for improvements in care quality presents a significant consideration. Therefore, this LAD falls into the "Consider" category, indicating that further assessment and potential improvements could make it a viable investment option in the future.
