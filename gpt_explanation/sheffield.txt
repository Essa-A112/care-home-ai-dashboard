The Local Authority District of Sheffield has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 8.85, primarily driven by its strong house price growth rate of 27.61%. This indicates a positive market outlook for property investments in the area. However, Sheffield's relatively lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 83.46% and a notable proportion requiring improvement at 13.53% may raise concerns about the overall quality of care facilities. Additionally, with 16.85% of the population being 65 years old or older, there is a growing demand for senior care services, presenting an opportunity for investment in care homes. The presence of a small percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 0.75% could suggest potential for differentiation and premium service offerings. Despite these strengths, the need to address quality issues and cater to the aging population presents risks that investors should carefully consider before committing to care home investments in Sheffield.
