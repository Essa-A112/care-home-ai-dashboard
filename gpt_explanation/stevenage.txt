The estimated care home investment potential score of 1.87 for Stevenage suggests a moderate outlook for care home investments in the area. Several key features contribute to this score. The relatively low House_Price_Growth_% and %_CQC_Good ratings indicate potential weaknesses in the local housing market and care home quality, which may pose challenges for investment returns. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over and the %_CQC_RequiresImprovement rate both negatively impact the score, signaling a potential strain on care services and facilities. On a positive note, the sizeable Total_Population figure presents an opportunity for demand in care services. However, the overall score indicates a need for careful consideration of the risks and advantages associated with investing in care homes in Stevenage, balancing factors like population size with challenges in housing market dynamics and care quality.
