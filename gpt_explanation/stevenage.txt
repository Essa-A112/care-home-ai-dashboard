The investment potential score for Stevenage, with a value of 29.98, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investment. This is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good," at 85.71%, indicating room for improvement in care quality. Additionally, the percentage of homes requiring improvement stands at 14.29%, further highlighting the need for enhancements in the care provided. Moreover, the negative house price growth rate of -1.41% suggests potential economic challenges within the area. With a relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 15.53%, demand for care services may be limited. The ratio of care homes per 10,000 residents is also relatively low, indicating potential saturation in the market. Considering these factors, Stevenage's current investment potential does not favor immediate investment. However, with targeted improvements in care quality and economic conditions, the district may become more favorable for investment in the future.
