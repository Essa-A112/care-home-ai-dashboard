The Local Authority District of Stevenage has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.87, placing it in the Avoid category. This score is influenced by several key features. The area shows a low House Price Growth percentage, a high percentage of Good CQC ratings, and a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over, all of which have negative impacts on the investment potential. However, the positive impact of a sizable total population in the district provides some potential. Overall, Stevenage is deemed unsuitable for investment at present due to the unfavorable combination of these factors. With improvements in areas such as house price growth and CQC ratings, there may be potential for reconsideration in the future.
