Adur, as a Local Authority District, has shown promising investment potential in the care home sector with a score of 7.09. This score likely stems from its strong house price growth, indicating a buoyant property market that could support future care home developments. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) may pose a challenge for investors seeking high-quality care facilities. Additionally, the proportion of residents aged 65 and over is significant, suggesting a growing demand for senior care services in the area. Investors should consider the need for improvements in CQC ratings to ensure the long-term success and reputation of any care home investments in Adur.
