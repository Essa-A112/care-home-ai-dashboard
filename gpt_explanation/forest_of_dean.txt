The Forest of Dean Local Authority District has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 37.57, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key features. One notable strength is its robust House Price Growth percentage of 26.83, indicating a positive trend in the housing market that could attract investors. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (9.52%) and the dominance of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (88.1%) suggest areas for enhancement in the quality of care services provided. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is also a positive factor at 25.33%, indicating a potentially growing demand for care services. With a moderate Care Homes per 10k value of 4.71, there is room for expansion in this sector. Overall, while the Forest of Dean LAD shows promise for investment, there are areas that require attention. Considering its current score falls within the "Consider" range, further improvements in care home quality and potentially increasing the care home capacity could elevate its investment attractiveness in the future.
