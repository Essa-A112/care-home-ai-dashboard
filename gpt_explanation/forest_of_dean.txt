The Forest of Dean Local Authority District has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 8.50, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district benefits from a strong House Price Growth percentage of 22.56%, indicating a healthy real estate market. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 25.33% suggests a potential demand for care home services. However, there are areas for improvement as indicated by the percentages of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" and "Good" by the Care Quality Commission. With 9.52% of care homes requiring improvement and 88.1% rated as good, there is room for enhancement in care quality standards. Despite these weaknesses, the Forest of Dean presents a balanced investment opportunity, especially considering its Care Homes per 10k value of 4.71. Therefore, with some targeted improvements in care quality, this LAD could become even more attractive for investment in the future.
