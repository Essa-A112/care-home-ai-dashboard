The investment potential score for Pendle is 41.94, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Pendle exhibits a strong house price growth of 22.8%, indicating a positive trend in the local property market. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 21.74% is a positive indicator for potential investment. However, challenges exist as the percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the CQC stands at 78.26%, which may suggest a saturated market or high competition. The Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is 16896, which could impact the affordability of care services in the area. Despite no inadequate-rated care homes, the overall score places Pendle in the middle range for investment potential. It falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability but could be considered with strategic improvements. Further analysis and targeted interventions may enhance its attractiveness for care home investment in the future.
