The Local Authority District of Pendle has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 7.61, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Pendle exhibits a strong positive house price growth percentage, indicating a potentially favorable market for property investment. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, coupled with a lower GDHI per head and a smaller proportion of the population aged 65 or older, suggest areas for improvement. Additionally, the absence of care homes rated as "Outstanding" presents a potential risk in terms of quality of care provision. While Pendle falls within the range for consideration after enhancements, it may benefit from targeted improvements in care quality and infrastructure to elevate its investment potential further.
