The Local Authority District of Sutton has received a relatively low estimated care home investment potential score of 0.14, primarily due to several key factors. The district's high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and low percentage requiring improvement suggest a stable and well-regulated care home market. However, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above may indicate a smaller potential market for care home services. Additionally, with a modest house price growth rate and a total population size that is not particularly large, there may be limited demand for new care home developments in Sutton. Investors should consider these factors when assessing the investment potential in the district and weigh the stability of the existing market against the potential growth opportunities.
