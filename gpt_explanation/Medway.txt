The Local Authority District of Medway has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.75, indicating a moderate opportunity for investment. The positive factors contributing to this score include a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), along with lower proportions in the "Requires Improvement" and "Inadequate" categories. These favorable CQC ratings suggest a relatively well-regulated and quality care home market within the district. However, Medway faces challenges such as a decline in house price growth, which may impact the overall investment attractiveness. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is moderate, potentially indicating a lower demand for care home services compared to areas with higher proportions of elderly residents. Investors should consider these factors when assessing the potential risks and advantages of investing in care homes in Medway.
