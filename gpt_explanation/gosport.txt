The Local Authority District of Gosport has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.81, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 22.26%, indicating a potential demand for care services, other indicators paint a less favorable picture. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 82.76% and a significant proportion requiring improvement at 17.24% suggest existing care facilities may not meet expected standards. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is at 20007, indicating a potential economic constraint for residents seeking care services. With no care homes rated as "Outstanding," there is room for improvement in the quality of care provided in the district. Overall, the current state of affairs suggests that Gosport may not be suitable for immediate investment in the care home sector. Further improvements in care quality and economic factors could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
