The Local Authority District of Gosport has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.04, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This rating is primarily influenced by the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 17.24%, which negatively impacts the overall score. Additionally, the absence of care homes rated as 'Inadequate' is a positive aspect. Gosport's demographic makeup, with 22.26% of the population aged 65 and over, is a strength for potential care home investment. The moderate house price growth of 5.9% also indicates a stable economic environment. However, the significant percentage of care homes with room for improvement suggests that investment in the area may not yield optimal returns without substantial enhancements to care quality. Thus, Gosport is currently deemed unsuitable for investment but could be reconsidered after addressing the quality issues in its care homes.
