The Local Authority District of West Berkshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.09, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district shows a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating potential quality concerns. Additionally, although there are no care homes rated as "Inadequate," the percentage of those rated as "Requires Improvement" is noteworthy. On a positive note, West Berkshire exhibits promising house price growth, which could potentially attract investors. However, the overall score suggests that the district may not be suitable for immediate investment due to the prevalent quality issues in care homes. Improvement efforts could potentially shift its classification to a more favorable category in the future.
