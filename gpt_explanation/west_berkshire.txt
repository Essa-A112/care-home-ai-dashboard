West Berkshire has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 4.26, driven by several key factors. The district's high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' at 87.8% is a notable strength, indicating a strong track record of providing quality care services. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 9.76% suggests there may be room for enhancement in certain facilities. On the positive side, the significant house price growth of 7.24% and a high GDHI per head of 28281 reflect a robust economic environment, making it an attractive location for investment. Additionally, the small percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' at 2.44% presents a potential opportunity for improvement and expansion in this segment. Despite the overall positive outlook, a risk to consider is the need to address any underperforming care homes to maintain and further enhance the district's reputation for quality care services.
