The Local Authority District of Leeds has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.63, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score suggests that while there are opportunities for investment, some improvements may be needed to maximize its potential. Leeds displays notable strengths such as a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good standard of care provision. However, challenges exist, including a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and over, which could strain care services. Additionally, the relatively low Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per capita and a large total population may impact the affordability and demand for care services. Overall, while Leeds shows promise for investment with its positive CQC ratings, there are areas that require attention, particularly in addressing the needs of its aging population and ensuring affordability. Therefore, further assessment and targeted improvements are recommended before making significant investment decisions in this LAD.
