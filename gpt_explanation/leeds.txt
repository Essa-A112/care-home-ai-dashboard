The Local Authority District of Leeds has been evaluated with an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.08, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score indicates that while there is potential for investment, there are certain aspects that warrant attention. Leeds displays strengths in its relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, standing at 24.5%. However, challenges arise from factors such as modest house price growth at 2.74%, a lower percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 15.66%, and a higher proportion of care homes rated as "Good" by CQC at 72.19%, which may suggest limited room for improvement. With a score falling just below the threshold for direct investment suitability, Leeds may benefit from targeted enhancements to overcome its weaknesses and further boost its investment appeal. It is advisable to consider this district for investment after strategic improvements have been made to optimize its care home market potential.
