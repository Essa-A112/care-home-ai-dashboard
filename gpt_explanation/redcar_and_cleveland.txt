The Local Authority District of Redcar and Cleveland has an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.17, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district shows strengths in its positive house price growth percentage and the proportion of the population aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially stable market and a demographic likely to require care services. However, weaknesses are evident in the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, coupled with a notable percentage requiring improvement. The absence of inadequate-rated care homes is a positive sign. Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that while there are some favorable aspects, there are also risks associated with the quality of care provision in the area. Therefore, at this stage, Redcar and Cleveland is deemed unsuitable for investment, requiring further improvements to enhance its attractiveness for care home investments.
