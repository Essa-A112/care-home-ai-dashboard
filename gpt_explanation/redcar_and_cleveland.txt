The investment potential score of 5.98 for Redcar and Cleveland suggests caution in considering this area for care home investments. This rating is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, a notable percentage of 23.83 of the population being 65 years or older indicates a potentially higher demand for care services. Additionally, the significant house price growth of 14.42% may suggest a growing and potentially affluent local community. However, challenges arise from the relatively high percentage of care homes in need of improvement (10.87%) and a limited percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (89.13%). Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head for 2022 is relatively low at 17,686 GBP, which could impact the willingness and ability of residents to afford higher-end care services. In conclusion, based on the current data and assessment, Redcar and Cleveland falls into the 'Avoid' category for care home investments, primarily due to the need for improvement in care home quality and the lower income levels in the area.
