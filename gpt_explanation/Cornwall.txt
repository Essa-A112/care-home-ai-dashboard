Cornwall, as a Local Authority District, has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.48. This score can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the significant growth in house prices, coupled with a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, indicates a potentially strong demand for care home services in the area. Additionally, having a relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 people suggests an existing infrastructure to support the sector. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission is a notable weakness that could pose risks to potential investors. Despite this, the presence of a small percentage of outstanding care homes offers an advantage and potential for quality improvement within the market. Overall, Cornwall's score reflects a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, with strengths in demand indicators but also highlighting the need for quality assurance and improvement initiatives to mitigate associated risks.
