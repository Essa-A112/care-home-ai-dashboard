The Local Authority District of Spelthorne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 29.65, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Spelthorne boasts a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 66.67%, and a low percentage of care homes rated as "Inadequate" at 5.56%. However, the negative impacts of a significant decline in house price growth at -25.41% and a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 16.67% have weighed down the overall score. Additionally, the presence of a moderate percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 11.11% has also contributed negatively to the score. Given these factors, the current state of care home investment in Spelthorne suggests caution. While there are strengths in the quality of care homes, the challenges posed by house price trends and the need for improvement in some facilities indicate that this LAD may not be the most favorable for investment at present. Further improvements in house price growth and CQC ratings could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
