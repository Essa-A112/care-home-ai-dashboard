The Local Authority District of Spelthorne has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.39, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. While the percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 66.67%, other indicators paint a less favorable picture. The significant negative impact of a high percentage of the population aged 65 and over, coupled with a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement, suggests potential challenges in meeting the care needs of an aging demographic. Additionally, a decline in house price growth further dampens the investment outlook for care homes in Spelthorne. Given these factors, it is advisable to avoid investing in this LAD at present. Further improvements in CQC ratings and demographic trends may warrant reconsideration in the future.
