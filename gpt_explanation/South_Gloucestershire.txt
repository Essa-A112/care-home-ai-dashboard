The Local Authority District of South Gloucestershire seems to have a moderate care home investment potential score of 1.99, influenced by several key factors. The relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 75.58% is a strength, indicating a solid quality of care provision. However, the presence of a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement (11.63%) and a relatively low percentage of outstanding facilities (12.79%) signal some areas for improvement. Additionally, the moderate house price growth rate of 2.16% suggests a stable but not rapidly appreciating property market. The percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 18.73% may pose a challenge as it indicates a significant potential demand for care services. Overall, South Gloucestershire presents a mixed picture for care home investment, with strengths in care quality but potential risks due to the aging population and housing market dynamics.
