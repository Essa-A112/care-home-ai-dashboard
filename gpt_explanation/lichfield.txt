The Local Authority District of Lichfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.83, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Lichfield benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a good standard of care provision. The significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. However, the negative impact of a decline in house prices may pose a challenge for potential investors. Despite the absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" or "Outstanding," the overall score falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. Lichfield could be considered for investment after improvements to address the impact of house price growth, potentially unlocking its care home investment potential.
