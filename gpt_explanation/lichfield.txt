The Local Authority District of Lichfield has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.89, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of a significant decrease in House Price Growth (-18.05%) suggests a challenging economic environment for investment. However, the positive aspects include a relatively low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement (31.03%) and a high percentage of CQC Good ratings (68.97%), indicating a favorable quality of care provision. Additionally, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over (23.93%) suggests a potential demand for care services. Nonetheless, the lack of CQC Outstanding-rated facilities (0.0%) could limit the attractiveness of the care home market in Lichfield. Overall, given the current score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised for potential investors in this area until significant improvements are made to address the existing challenges and risks.
