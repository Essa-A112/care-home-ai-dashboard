The investment potential score of 4.44 for Bromley suggests a moderately favorable outlook for care home investments in the area. The district's relatively high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 85.71% is a strength, indicating a majority of facilities meet quality standards. However, the presence of 10.2% of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments poses a potential risk to investors. Additionally, with only 2.04% of care homes rated as 'Outstanding,' there may be limited opportunities for premium investments in top-tier facilities. The relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 17.9% could be a weakness, as a smaller elderly population may limit the demand for care services. On a positive note, the district's Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively high at Â£30,888, suggesting a potentially affluent local market for care services. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the overall investment potential in care homes within the Bromley area.
