The Local Authority District of Gateshead has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 30.47, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Gateshead exhibits a decline in House Price Growth (-9.93%) and a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement (14.04%), both of which have negatively impacted its overall score. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (75.44%) and a significant elderly population (20.43%), which have partially counterbalanced the negative aspects. However, the presence of a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" (7.02%) further contributes to the lower investment potential score. Given these factors, Gateshead is currently deemed unsuitable for investment. The district may benefit from enhancements in house price growth and the quality of care homes to potentially improve its investment attractiveness in the future.
