The Local Authority District of Gateshead has an estimated care home investment potential score of 1.61, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This rating is likely influenced by several key factors. Gateshead exhibits a decline in House Price Growth, a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, and a lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head compared to other areas. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over in Gateshead is relatively low. These factors collectively contribute to the lower investment potential score. Given these characteristics, Gateshead may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at the present time. Further improvements in CQC ratings, economic indicators, and demographic trends could potentially make it a more viable option in the future.
