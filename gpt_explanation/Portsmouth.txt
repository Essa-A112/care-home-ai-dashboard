Portsmouth's estimated care home investment potential score of 5.49 is influenced by several key factors. The relatively low House_Price_Growth% suggests a potentially stable property market, which can be a strength for investors seeking long-term returns. The high percentage of CQC Good ratings indicates a favorable quality of care in the area, appealing to investors looking for reputable care homes. However, the percentage of CQC Requires Improvement may raise concerns about the overall care standards. The low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over could be seen as a weakness for care home investment, as the demand for elderly care services may be lower. Additionally, the relatively low number of care homes per 10k population could present a notable risk, potentially indicating a saturated market or limited growth opportunities. Overall, while Portsmouth's strong quality ratings and stable property market are positive indicators, the lower demand and market saturation may pose challenges for investors in the care home sector.
