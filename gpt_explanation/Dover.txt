The Local Authority District of Dover has shown promising potential for care home investment with an impressive score of 8.99. This high score can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the strong house price growth of 10.89% indicates a positive economic environment that could attract investment. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 24.53% suggests a growing demand for care services in the area. Moreover, the low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 21.31% and a higher number of care homes per 10,000 people further support the attractiveness of investing in care facilities in Dover. However, the lower percentage of CQC outstanding ratings at 6.56% could pose a challenge in maintaining high-quality care standards. Investors should consider leveraging the area's strengths in economic growth and demand for care services while also addressing the need for improvement in care home quality to mitigate potential risks and maximize returns on investment.
