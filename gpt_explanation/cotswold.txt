The Local Authority District of Cotswold has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.64, primarily driven by several key features. The district boasts a strong house price growth percentage, indicating a healthy property market that can attract investment. With a significant percentage of residents aged 65 and over, there is a clear demand for care services in the area. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is relatively high, suggesting a population with greater spending power for care services. Moreover, the majority of care facilities in the district have received positive ratings from the Care Quality Commission, reflecting well on the overall quality of care provided. However, there are some areas of improvement to consider, such as the percentage of facilities requiring improvement according to CQC assessments. This could pose a risk to potential investors seeking consistent quality across care homes in the area. Overall, Cotswold presents a promising investment opportunity in the care home sector, with strengths in property market growth, demographic demand, and income levels, alongside notable risks related to the quality of care services provided.
