The Local Authority District of Cotswold has shown promising indicators for care home investment with an estimated potential score of 44.08, placing it in the 'Consider' category. Positive features such as a significant House Price Growth of 16.14% and a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 21.05% contribute to its appeal. Additionally, a considerable proportion of the population aged 65 and above at 26.97% suggests a potential demand for care services. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 73.68% may pose challenges in achieving significant improvements. Despite the absence of inadequate care homes, it is essential to address the existing quality standards to enhance the overall care provision. While Cotswold falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, it presents opportunities for further assessment and potential enhancements to elevate its investment attractiveness.
