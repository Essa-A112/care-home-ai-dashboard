The Local Authority District of Hinckley and Bosworth has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.76, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The district's negative house price growth rate and the high percentage of care homes requiring improvement and with good ratings contribute to its lower score. On a positive note, Hinckley and Bosworth has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and above, which is a favorable indicator for care home demand. With a total population of 114,970, there is a significant potential market for care home services. However, the overall score suggests that significant improvements may be needed in the care home sector in this district to make it a suitable investment opportunity. As it stands, caution is advised for potential investors due to the existing challenges in the local care home market.
