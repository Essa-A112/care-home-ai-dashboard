Guildford has a relatively strong care home investment potential score of 6.08, primarily influenced by key features such as a high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 72.41% and a low percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 24.14%. These factors indicate a favorable quality of care homes in the area, which can attract potential investors. Additionally, the high GDHI per head in 2022 at Â£32,201 suggests a relatively affluent population that may be willing to invest in premium care services. However, Guildford does face challenges such as a slight decline in house price growth and a lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 17.21%, which could impact the demand for care services. Despite these weaknesses, the overall indicators point towards a stable and potentially lucrative investment opportunity in the care home sector in Guildford.
