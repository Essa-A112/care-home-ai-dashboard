The Local Authority District of Hart has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.57, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Hart's house price growth percentage is negative, indicating a potentially challenging property market. While the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 68.75%, the proportion of homes rated as "Outstanding" is lower at 12.5%. Additionally, the percentage of homes requiring improvement stands at 18.75%. On a positive note, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is at 30226, suggesting a decent economic base. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, primarily due to the mix of CQC ratings and house price growth. Considering these factors, it is advisable to avoid immediate investment in care homes in the Hart area until improvements are made to address the existing challenges and risks.
