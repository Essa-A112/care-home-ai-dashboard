The Local Authority District of Hart has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.15, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This classification is primarily influenced by several key factors. Notably, the percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively low at 12.5%, indicating a potential weakness in the quality of care provision within the district. Additionally, the house price growth percentage and the number of care homes per 10,000 residents are also below optimal levels, further dampening the investment potential. On a positive note, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement is at 18.75%, suggesting room for growth and enhancement in the care home sector within Hart. However, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, signaling potential risks in terms of returns on investment. Therefore, at present, Hart may not be the most favorable location for care home investment, but with improvements in quality and market conditions, it could become a more viable option in the future.
