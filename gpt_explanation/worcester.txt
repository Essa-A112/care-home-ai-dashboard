The investment potential score of -0.24 for Worcester suggests a relatively unfavorable environment for care home investments in this Local Authority District. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Firstly, the negative house price growth percentage indicates a declining or stagnant property market, potentially impacting the value of care home properties. Additionally, a high percentage of CQC requiring improvement and a lower proportion of CQC-rated good care homes signal challenges in the quality of existing care facilities. The relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services in the area. Furthermore, the modest GDHI per head figure implies a lower average income level, which could affect the affordability of care services for residents. Investors should consider these factors as potential risks when evaluating opportunities in the care home sector in Worcester.
