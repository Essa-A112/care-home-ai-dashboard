The Local Authority District of Worcester has been assessed to have an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.24, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features that indicate challenges for care home investment in this area. The negative impact of factors such as a decrease in House Price Growth, a relatively high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement ratings, a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and over, a significant proportion of CQC Good ratings, and a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head all contribute to the unfavorable score. These factors collectively suggest potential risks and limitations for investing in care homes in Worcester. Given the score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised when considering care home investments in this LAD without significant improvements in the identified areas.
