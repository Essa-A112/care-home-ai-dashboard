The Local Authority District of Crawley has received a low care home investment potential score of -6.91, primarily due to several key negative factors. The area exhibits a declining House Price Growth percentage, indicating a potential lack of robust real estate market performance. Moreover, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggests a saturated market with limited room for improvement or expansion. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above may indicate a smaller target demographic for care home services. The Gross Disposable Household Income per capita is also below average, potentially impacting the affordability and demand for premium care services. These factors collectively contribute to Crawley's lower investment potential in the care home sector. However, the area may benefit from strong infrastructure and amenities, offering a foundation for future growth if strategic investments are made to address the identified weaknesses.
