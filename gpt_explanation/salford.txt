The Local Authority District of Salford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 36.50, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score suggests that Salford may not be conducive to care home investments based on various key features. The district's relatively low percentage of care homes with a "Good" rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 79.55% and a high percentage requiring improvement at 20.45% indicate potential quality concerns. Additionally, the low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 12.85% and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 population at 1.55 could suggest a limited demand for care home services in the area. On the positive side, Salford shows promising house price growth at 10.83%, which could offer potential returns for investors. However, given the overall score falling below the investment threshold, it is advisable to exercise caution when considering care home investments in Salford, as improvements may be needed to make it a more viable option for investment.
