The Local Authority District of Salford received a care home investment potential score of 4.11, indicating moderate potential in this area. Several key features contribute to this score. Salford has a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above, which may suggest less immediate demand for care homes compared to areas with an older population. Additionally, the house price growth rate is positive but relatively modest, potentially affecting the investment attractiveness for care home developments. The number of care homes per 10,000 residents is also somewhat lower, indicating potential opportunities for expansion in this sector. However, the GDHI per head and total population figures are on the lower side, signaling potential challenges in terms of affordability and scale of demand. Overall, while Salford shows potential for care home investments, factors like population demographics and economic indicators suggest a need for careful consideration of both risks and opportunities in this market.
