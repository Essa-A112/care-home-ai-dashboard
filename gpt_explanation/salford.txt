The Local Authority District of Salford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.11, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment at the present time. This score is influenced by several key factors. Salford's relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, limited growth in house prices, below-average number of care homes per 10,000 people, lower GDHI per capita, and a sizable total population all contribute to its lower investment potential. While Salford may offer strengths such as a diverse population and potential for future growth, these factors indicate current limitations in its suitability for care home investment. Therefore, it falls into the avoid category based on the scoring criteria. However, with strategic improvements in the availability and quality of care facilities, Salford could potentially move into the consideration category in the future.
