North West Leicestershire has shown a promising care home investment potential with a score of 52.16, categorizing it as "Good" for investment. The district's strengths lie in its high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 60%, coupled with a positive house price growth of 12.5%. These factors contribute positively to the overall investment potential score. However, there is room for improvement as 40% of care homes in the area require improvement according to the CQC. This aspect presents an opportunity for investors to potentially enhance the quality of care services and facilities in the district. The absence of any care homes rated as "Outstanding" or "Inadequate" could be seen as a potential risk, as it may indicate a lack of diversity in care home quality levels. Overall, North West Leicestershire's favorable scores suggest it is suitable for investment, with the potential for further enhancements to solidify its position as an attractive investment opportunity in the care home sector.
