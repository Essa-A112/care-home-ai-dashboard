The Local Authority District of Fylde has shown promising potential for care home investments with an estimated score of 8.02. One of its strengths lies in the relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. Additionally, the majority of care homes in Fylde have received a "Good" rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), highlighting the quality of care provided in the area. The presence of a moderate percentage of CQC-registered establishments requiring improvement suggests opportunities for enhancement and growth in the sector. However, Fylde faces challenges such as a slight decline in house price growth, which could impact investment returns. Despite this, the relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 residents signifies a competitive market, offering both advantages in terms of choice for investors and risks related to market saturation. Overall, Fylde presents a balanced landscape for care home investments with opportunities for growth and quality improvement.
