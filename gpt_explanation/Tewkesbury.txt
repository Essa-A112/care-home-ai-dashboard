The Local Authority District of Tewkesbury has a moderate estimated care home investment potential score of 5.24, influenced by various key factors. The relatively low House_Price_Growth% may pose a challenge for investors seeking quick returns in the property market. However, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is notably high at 22.39%, indicating a potentially strong demand for care home services in the area. The high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (77.78%) suggests a favorable operating environment for investors in terms of quality assurance. On the downside, the presence of a significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement (16.67%) may indicate operational risks or areas needing attention. Additionally, the relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 residents could signal a potential opportunity for growth and expansion in the care home sector within Tewkesbury. Overall, while there are both strengths and weaknesses in the investment potential of care homes in this district, investors should consider the demographic trends and quality of existing care facilities as they assess the risks and advantages of investing in Tewkesbury's care home market.
