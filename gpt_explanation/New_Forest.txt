The Local Authority District of New Forest appears to have a promising care home investment potential score of 7.98, primarily due to several key factors. With a relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, there is a clear demand for care services within the district. Additionally, the above-average number of care homes per 10,000 residents suggests a supportive infrastructure for the sector. The strong house price growth and Gross Disposable Household Income per head further indicate a potentially affluent population that may be willing to invest in quality care facilities. However, the presence of a notable percentage of CQC-Requires Improvement ratings could pose a risk, indicating areas where improvements may be necessary to meet regulatory standards and maintain a positive reputation. Overall, New Forest presents a favorable landscape for care home investments, but stakeholders should be mindful of addressing any areas requiring improvement to maximize the opportunities presented by the district.
