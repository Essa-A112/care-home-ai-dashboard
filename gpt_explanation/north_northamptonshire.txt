The investment potential score of 28.64 for North Northamptonshire places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for investment in care homes within this area. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits challenges such as a significant decline in house price growth by -26.7%, a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 18.25%, and a large total population of 367,991. On the positive side, North Northamptonshire has a decent number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 3.42 and a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission at 73.81%. However, the overall score suggests that despite these strengths, the district may not currently offer the most favorable environment for care home investments. Further improvements in areas such as house price growth and CQC ratings could potentially enhance its investment potential.
