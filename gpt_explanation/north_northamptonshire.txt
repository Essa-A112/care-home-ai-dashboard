North Northamptonshire has a care home investment potential score of -2.15, indicating a relatively low potential for investment in this area. The negative impact on house price growth, with a decrease of 26.16%, is a significant weakness as it suggests a lack of appreciation in property values. The relatively low percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 73.81% and a notable proportion requiring improvement at 18.25% are areas of concern, indicating potential quality issues within the care home sector. Additionally, the large total population of 367,991 people and a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 18.37% may suggest a higher demand for care services that could strain existing resources. These factors collectively contribute to the lower investment potential score, highlighting the need for improvements in housing market performance and care home quality to attract potential investors and address the growing demands of an aging population.
