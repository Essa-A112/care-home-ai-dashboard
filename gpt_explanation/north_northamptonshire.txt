The investment potential score for North Northamptonshire indicates a need for caution, falling into the "Avoid" category with a score of -2.15. This is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 73.81%, other indicators point to challenges. The significant decline in house price growth (-26.16%) suggests potential economic instability in the area, which could impact investment returns. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over (18.37%) may indicate a smaller target market for care home services. Considering these factors, North Northamptonshire may not be suitable for immediate investment. Further analysis and potential improvements in economic conditions and demographic trends could make it a more viable option in the future.
