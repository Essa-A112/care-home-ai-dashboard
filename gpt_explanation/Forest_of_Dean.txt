The Forest of Dean Local Authority District has shown promising investment potential with a high estimated care home investment score of 8.50. This score is likely attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the strong house price growth percentage indicates a healthy and growing property market, which could attract investors looking for long-term gains. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC requiring improvement and high percentage of CQC rated as good reflect a generally high standard of care facilities in the area, potentially appealing to those seeking quality care home investments. The significant proportion of individuals aged 65 and over suggests a growing elderly population, increasing the demand for care services. Furthermore, the relatively high number of care homes per 10,000 people indicates an established care infrastructure. However, the lower percentages of CQC rated as good could pose a risk in maintaining consistent quality across all care homes. Investors should consider balancing the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks to make informed decisions in this market.
