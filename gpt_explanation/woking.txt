The Local Authority District of Woking has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.62, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This classification is primarily influenced by several key features. While the district boasts a relatively high house price growth rate of 15.96%, indicating potential economic prosperity, it is outweighed by concerning factors such as a low percentage of CQC 'Good' rated care homes at 84.62%. Additionally, the presence of 11.54% of care homes requiring improvement and a relatively small proportion of the population aged 65 and over at 17.02% contribute to the lower investment potential score. With no care homes rated as 'Inadequate', there is a baseline level of quality present. However, the overall analysis suggests that Woking may not be currently suitable for immediate investment due to the identified weaknesses in care home quality and demographic factors. Further improvements in care home ratings and an increase in the older population percentage could potentially shift this district into a more favorable investment category in the future.
