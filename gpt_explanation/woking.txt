The Local Authority District of Woking has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.79, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Woking exhibits a positive House Price Growth of 9.69%, indicating a potentially lucrative property market. However, challenges arise from a high percentage of CQC Requires Improvement at 11.54% and a relatively low percentage of CQC Good at 84.62%, signaling areas for care quality enhancement. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over stands at 17.02%, suggesting a significant demand for elderly care services. Despite a relatively high GDHI per head of Â£29,827, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Therefore, based on these factors, Woking may not be ideal for immediate investment without significant improvements in care quality and addressing the aging population's needs.
