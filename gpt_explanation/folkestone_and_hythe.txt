The Local Authority District of Folkestone and Hythe has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.09, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 25.53%, indicating a potentially strong demand for care home services. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is above average, suggesting a competitive market. However, the area faces challenges such as a decline in house price growth, which may impact the investment returns. Furthermore, while a majority of care homes are rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the presence of a notable percentage categorized as 'Requires Improvement' raises concerns about the overall quality of care provision. Considering these factors, Folkestone and Hythe is not currently recommended for investment due to its low score, indicating potential risks and the need for improvements in various aspects to make it a more attractive option for investment in care homes.
