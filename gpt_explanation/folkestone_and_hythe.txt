The Local Authority District of Folkestone and Hythe has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.35, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating a potential demand for care home services. However, challenges arise from a notable decline in house price growth and a significant proportion of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings. These weaknesses may impact the profitability and attractiveness of investing in care homes within this area. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised when considering care home investments in Folkestone and Hythe until improvements are made to address the identified weaknesses.
