The Oldham Local Authority District has an estimated care home investment potential score of 9.55, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, Oldham has experienced significant house price growth, indicating a potentially favorable investment environment. However, challenges exist as well. The percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes is relatively low at 81.4%, suggesting room for improvement in care quality. Additionally, a notable proportion of the population is aged 65 and over, which may increase demand for care services but also pose operational challenges. The district's GDHI per head is moderate, potentially impacting the affordability of care services. Overall, while Oldham shows promise with positive house price growth, there are areas that warrant attention such as enhancing care quality and addressing demographic trends. Therefore, it may be considered for investment after improvements are made to mitigate risks and capitalize on its strengths.
