Oldham's high estimated care home investment potential score of 9.55 can be attributed to several key factors. The significant house price growth percentage of 29.02 indicates a robust property market, potentially making it attractive for investors. However, the relatively low percentage of CQC-rated good care homes at 81.4% and a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement at 18.6% suggest a mixed quality landscape that investors may need to navigate. Additionally, with 15.92% of the population aged 65 and over, there is a clear demand for care services, presenting an opportunity for investment in this sector. Despite these strengths, the relatively lower GDHI per head in 2022 at 16499 could pose a challenge in terms of the affordability and willingness of residents to pay for premium care services. Investors should carefully consider these factors to make informed decisions and mitigate any risks associated with the investment potential in Oldham's care home market.
