Oldham's care home investment potential score of 39.85 places it in the "Consider" category, suggesting a moderate level of suitability for investment. The district exhibits strengths in House Price Growth at 25.95%, indicating a positive trend in property values. However, weaknesses are evident in the percentage of CQC Good ratings at 81.4% and the proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 15.92%, both negatively influencing the score. Additionally, the low percentage of CQC Inadequate ratings at 0.0% is a positive factor. With a GDHI per head of 16499, a negative impact on the score is observed.

Further analysis and potential enhancements could move it into a more favorable category for investment consideration.
