The Local Authority District of Tonbridge and Malling has an estimated care home investment potential score of 30.09, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 82.35%, other indicators present challenges. With a relatively low house price growth of 0.23% and a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 11.76%, Tonbridge and Malling faces obstacles in attracting investment. Additionally, the low number of care homes per 10,000 residents further impacts its overall potential for care home investment. Given these factors, Tonbridge and Malling currently falls below the threshold for investment suitability. Further improvements in CQC ratings and house price growth may be necessary to enhance its attractiveness for investment in the future.
