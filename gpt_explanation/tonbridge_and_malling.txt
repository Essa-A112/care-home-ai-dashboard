The investment potential score of 2.34 for Tonbridge and Malling suggests that it may not be the most favorable location for care home investments. Several key features contribute to this assessment. The relatively low House_Price_Growth_% indicates limited potential for property value appreciation, which may impact investment returns. Additionally, the percentages of care homes with CQC ratings of Good and Requires Improvement are not particularly strong, indicating potential quality concerns within the local care home sector. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and above being at 19.31% suggests a moderate demand for care services, but the Care_Homes_per_10k figure of 1.26 is relatively low, potentially signaling a saturated market. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the investment potential in Tonbridge and Malling, taking into account the risks and limitations associated with the current state of the care home industry in this area.
