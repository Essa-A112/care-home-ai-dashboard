The Local Authority District of Tonbridge and Malling has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.34, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Tonbridge and Malling exhibits a modest House Price Growth percentage, coupled with a relatively low percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of 'Good'. Additionally, the proportion of individuals aged 65 and over is moderate, while the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is also on the lower side. These factors collectively contribute to the district's lower investment potential score. Given these attributes, Tonbridge and Malling may not be an ideal location for care home investment at the present time. However, with potential improvements in CQC ratings and an increase in care home availability, the district could become more attractive for investment in the future.
