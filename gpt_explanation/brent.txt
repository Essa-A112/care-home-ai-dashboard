The Local Authority District of Brent has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of -3.36, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Brent exhibits a significant decline in House Price Growth percentage at -19.04, indicating potential economic challenges. Moreover, the high proportion of the population aged 65 and above, standing at 12.08%, suggests a greater demand for care services that may strain existing facilities. While the majority of care homes in Brent are rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (86.67%), the presence of a notable percentage requiring improvement (13.33%) raises concerns about the overall quality of care provision. With a total population of 344,521, the district may face capacity issues in meeting the care needs of its residents. Given these factors, Brent's current state does not present an attractive investment opportunity in the care home sector.
