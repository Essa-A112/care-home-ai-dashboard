The Local Authority District of Brent has an estimated care home investment potential score of 18.53, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced primarily by several key factors. While the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively high, indicating potential financial stability in the area, other factors contribute to the lower overall score. Brent faces challenges such as a significant percentage of properties experiencing a decrease in house price growth, a notable proportion of care facilities requiring improvement according to CQC assessments, and a smaller percentage of the population being 65 years or older. These factors collectively suggest potential risks in investing in care homes within this district. Given the current score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, caution is advised when considering care home investments in Brent until improvements are made in the identified areas of concern.
