The Local Authority District of Cambridge has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -4.11, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This rating is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a significant decline in house price growth percentage, indicating a potential lack of economic growth. Moreover, the high percentage of elderly residents at 11.43% suggests a demand for care services, but the low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 92.31% raises concerns about the quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, the absence of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' is a positive aspect, yet the presence of some facilities rated as 'Inadequate' at 7.69% poses a risk to potential investors. Given these considerations, and the overall negative score, Cambridge is deemed unsuitable for investment at this time, requiring substantial improvements in various aspects to become a viable option for care home investments.
