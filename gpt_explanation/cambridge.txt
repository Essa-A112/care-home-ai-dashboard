The Local Authority District of Cambridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of -4.11, indicating a less favorable environment for care home investments. This score is influenced by several key factors. Despite a relatively low percentage of inadequate CQC ratings at 7.69%, other metrics are less favorable. The high house price growth percentage and the significant proportion of the population aged 65 and over suggest potential financial challenges for investing in care homes. Additionally, while the majority of care homes have a good CQC rating at 92.31%, the absence of any homes requiring improvement may indicate limited opportunities for value enhancement through renovation or upgrades. Investors in Cambridge may face difficulties in achieving strong returns due to the combination of high property costs and an older population demographic, highlighting the need for careful risk assessment and strategic planning in this market.
