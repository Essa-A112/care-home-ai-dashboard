The Local Authority District of Cambridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of 19.76, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. The district has a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, indicating that there may be limited room for improvement in the existing facilities. Additionally, the negative house price growth and relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over suggest potential challenges in attracting clientele who may require care services. However, the absence of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" is a positive aspect. Despite this, the overall profile indicates that Cambridge may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. It falls below the threshold for consideration and would likely require significant improvements to become a viable investment opportunity.
