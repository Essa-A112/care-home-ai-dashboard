Great Yarmouth has a promising care home investment potential score of 16.74, primarily attributed to several key factors. The district exhibits a healthy House Price Growth percentage of 18.08%, indicating a positive market trend that could enhance the value of care home properties. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC Inadequate ratings at 2.86% suggests a generally satisfactory quality of care within the area, boosting investor confidence. Moreover, with 24.63% of the population aged 65 and over, there is a significant demographic demand for senior care services. However, the moderate proportion of CQC Requires Improvement at 40% indicates room for operational enhancements in some facilities. Investors should remain vigilant of potential risks associated with maintaining and improving care quality to capitalize fully on the district's investment potential.
