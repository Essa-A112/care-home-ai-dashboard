Kingston upon Thames has an estimated care home investment potential score of 23.76, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district has a relatively low percentage of CQC Good and Outstanding care homes at 84.09% and 9.09% respectively, indicating room for improvement in the quality of care provided. Additionally, with 6.82% of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC, there are areas that need attention to meet regulatory standards. The negative house price growth of -8.66% suggests a potential lack of economic growth and investment opportunities in the area. Furthermore, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 14.89% may indicate a smaller target market for care home services. Considering these factors, Kingston upon Thames may not be the most favorable location for care home investment at present. It is advisable to focus on areas with higher investment potential scores for better opportunities in the care home sector.
