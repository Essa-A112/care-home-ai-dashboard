The investment potential score of -1.30 for Kingston upon Thames indicates a relatively unfavorable outlook for care home investments in this local authority district. Several key features contribute to this score. The negative house price growth percentage suggests a downward trend in property values, potentially impacting the overall investment return. The relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement (6.82%) and the lower percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (84.09%) indicate potential quality concerns within the care home sector in Kingston upon Thames. Additionally, the modest proportion of the population aged 65 and over (14.89%) may suggest a limited demand for care home services. On a positive note, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively high at Â£31,129, which could indicate a certain level of affordability among residents. However, the combination of these factors, including the negative house price growth and quality issues in care homes, likely contributed to the overall low investment potential score for this area. Investors should carefully consider these strengths, weaknesses, and risks before making investment decisions in the care home sector in Kingston upon Thames.
