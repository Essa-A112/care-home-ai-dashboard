The investment potential score for Kingston upon Thames, with a value of -1.30, places it in the "Avoid" category for care home investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The negative impact of house price growth, the percentage of care homes requiring improvement, and the proportion of the population aged 65 and over all contribute to this lower score. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission and the above-average Gross Disposable Household Income per capita in 2022 provide some positive aspects. Overall, despite these strengths, the combination of negative influences outweighs the positive indicators, resulting in a recommendation to avoid investing in care homes in this Local Authority District at present. Further improvements in the areas of house price growth and care home quality may make it a more viable option for investment in the future.
