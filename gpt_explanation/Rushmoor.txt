The Local Authority District of Rushmoor received a care home investment potential score of 1.84, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for such investments. Several factors contribute to this score, including a relatively low percentage of CQC outstanding ratings and a higher proportion of homes requiring improvement, suggesting potential quality issues within the care home sector. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively low, potentially limiting the immediate demand for care home services. On the positive side, the region has seen healthy house price growth, which could indicate a strong local economy and potential for increased property values. However, the relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 residents may present a risk in terms of meeting future demand for elderly care services. Overall, Rushmoor presents a mixed picture for care home investments, with both strengths and weaknesses that investors should carefully consider before making decisions.
