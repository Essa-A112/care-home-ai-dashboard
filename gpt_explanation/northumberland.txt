The investment potential score for Northumberland is 5.75, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is relatively high at 26.29%, indicating a potential demand for care home services. Additionally, a significant proportion of care homes in the area are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, standing at 79.82%. However, Northumberland faces challenges such as a lower house price growth rate of 2.80% and a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement, at 16.51%. With a total population of 327,055, the market size may also pose a limitation. Considering these factors, Northumberland may not be an ideal location for immediate care home investment due to its overall score falling below the recommended threshold. Further improvements in areas like house price growth and care home quality could potentially make it a more viable investment option in the future.
