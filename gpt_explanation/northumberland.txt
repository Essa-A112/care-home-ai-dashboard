The investment potential score for Northumberland, standing at 36.10, places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution in considering it for care home investments. This score is influenced by various factors. While the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above in the area is relatively high at 26.29%, a positive aspect for care home investments, the presence of a significant proportion of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 16.51% and a limited percentage rated as "Good" at 79.82% raise concerns. The absence of care homes rated as "Inadequate" is a positive point, but the overall picture suggests a need for improvement in care home quality. Additionally, the moderate house price growth of 4.61% provides a potential advantage for investment. Given these factors, Northumberland is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment due to the need for enhancements in care home quality. Further evaluation and potential improvements could position it for consideration in the future.
