The investment potential score of 1.52 for West Suffolk suggests a moderate outlook for care home investments in the area. The positive impact from a relatively high percentage of CQC ratings indicating 'Good' or 'Requires Improvement' suggests a favorable quality of care provision within the district, potentially attracting investors. However, the negative impact from a low percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' and the significant negative SHAP impact from House Price Growth and GDHI per head could pose challenges. The below-average House Price Growth and GDHI figures may indicate lower economic prosperity in the region, potentially affecting the affordability and demand for care home services. Investors in West Suffolk should consider these factors when evaluating the potential risks and advantages associated with care home investments in the area.
