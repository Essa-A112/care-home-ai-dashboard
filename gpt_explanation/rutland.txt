Rutland, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 13.56, falls into the 'Good' category, making it a promising prospect for investment. This is supported by several key features that contribute positively to its score. For instance, the strong house price growth of 19.30% indicates a healthy economic environment, while the relatively low percentage of CQC requires improvement at 25.0% suggests a good quality of existing care facilities. Additionally, with 26.32% of the population aged 65 and above, there is a clear demographic demand for care services. The high GDHI per head of Â£28,090 further underlines the area's economic stability. However, potential risks may lie in the relatively small total population of 40,643, which could limit the scale of the care home market. Overall, Rutland's positive indicators make it suitable for investment, offering a promising opportunity for care home development and expansion.
