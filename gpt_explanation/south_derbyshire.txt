The Local Authority District of South Derbyshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.14, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district has a relatively high percentage of properties experiencing house price growth, which is a positive indicator for investment, it is offset by a significant proportion of care homes rated as requiring improvement and a lower percentage of those rated as good by the Care Quality Commission. Additionally, the absence of care homes rated as inadequate is a positive aspect. The total population of 114,050 is a potential strength for investment. Overall, South Derbyshire falls below the threshold for investment suitability due to the challenges posed by the need for improvement in care home quality. Further enhancements in care home standards could potentially shift its status to being considered for investment in the future.
