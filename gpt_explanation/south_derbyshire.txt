The Local Authority District of South Derbyshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.92, categorizing it as being in the "Avoid" range. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district exhibits a positive feature in house price growth, indicating potential economic activity. However, South Derbyshire faces challenges such as a high percentage of CQC requiring improvement and a lower percentage of CQC rated as good, suggesting room for enhancement in care quality. With a relatively low proportion of the population aged 65 and over and lower GDHI per head compared to other areas, there may be limited demand for care services. Considering these aspects, South Derbyshire is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. Improvement strategies could be explored to address the identified weaknesses before reconsidering its investment potential in the future.
