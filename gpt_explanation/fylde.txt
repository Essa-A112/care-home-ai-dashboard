The Local Authority District of Fylde has shown a moderate care home investment potential score of 8.02, placing it in the "Consider" category. Several key features contribute to this evaluation. Fylde has a relatively high percentage of residents over 65 years old at 28.79%, indicating a potential demand for care services. Additionally, the presence of 4.89 care homes per 10,000 people suggests an existing infrastructure to support such services. On the downside, the negative house price growth rate of -0.067% may raise concerns about the economic stability of the area. However, the majority of care homes in Fylde are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, with only 21.95% requiring improvement, reflecting a generally high standard of care provision. While Fylde falls short of the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its promising demographic indicators and strong CQC ratings suggest that with targeted improvements, it could become a more attractive investment prospect in the future.
