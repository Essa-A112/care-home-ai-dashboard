The Local Authority District of Fylde has an estimated care home investment potential score of 41.01, positioning it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed profile with both positive and negative factors influencing its investment suitability. Fylde benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement (21.95%) and a substantial population of individuals aged 65 and above (28.79%), indicating a potential demand for care services. However, challenges arise from a modest house price growth rate of 3.69% and a comparatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC (75.61%), suggesting a competitive market. The district's above-average number of care homes per 10,000 people (4.89) could indicate saturation or potential oversupply. Overall, Fylde falls into the category that may be considered for investment after improvements, as it possesses strengths but also faces notable risks and competition. Further enhancements to address market saturation and capitalize on the aging population could enhance its investment appeal.
