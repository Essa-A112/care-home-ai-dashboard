The Local Authority District of Havering has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.41, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While Havering boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the presence of a significant elderly population and a lower proportion of outstanding care homes contribute to the overall score. The absence of inadequate-rated care homes is a positive aspect, but the need for improvement in a notable portion of care facilities suggests potential risks. Given its current standing, Havering is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. However, with strategic improvements in care quality and services, this district could become a viable option for investment in the future.
