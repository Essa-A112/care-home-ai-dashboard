The Local Authority District of Havering has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.94, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several factors. While Havering has a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the high proportion of care homes rated as "Good" and the lower percentage of residents aged 65 and over have a negative impact on the score. On the positive side, the district experiences a moderate level of house price growth and a small percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the CQC.

Considering these factors, Havering may not be deemed suitable for immediate investment due to its lower overall investment potential score. The district's strengths lie in the quality of its care homes and the growth in house prices, which could potentially attract investors in the future. However, the relatively lower percentage of elderly residents may limit the demand for care home services in the area, affecting the investment potential. Therefore, unless significant improvements are made in key areas such as increasing the elderly population or enhancing care home quality, it may be prudent to avoid investing in care homes in Havering at present.
