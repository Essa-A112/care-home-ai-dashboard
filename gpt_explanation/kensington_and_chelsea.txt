The Local Authority District of Kensington and Chelsea has an estimated care home investment potential score of 6.32, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong quality of care provision. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head is relatively high, suggesting a potentially affluent demographic able to afford care services. However, there are notable weaknesses to consider. The lack of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC may limit opportunities for value enhancement through refurbishments or upgrades. Moreover, the negative house price growth rate could impact the affordability of care services for residents. With a score falling within the "Consider" range, Kensington and Chelsea may be suitable for investment after careful evaluation and potential improvements to address the identified weaknesses and risks.
