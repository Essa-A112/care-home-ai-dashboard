The Local Authority District of Kensington and Chelsea has an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.94, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Despite a positive impact from house price growth at 5.55%, the district faces challenges due to its low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 14.79%. Additionally, the lack of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 25.0% and a notable absence of facilities requiring improvement at 0.0% contribute to the lower score. With a total population of 147,460, Kensington and Chelsea may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in the availability and quality of care facilities could potentially enhance its attractiveness for investment in the future.
