The Local Authority District of Hammersmith and Fulham has received a care home investment potential score of -0.69, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. The high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 91.67% is a strength. However, the low percentage requiring improvement, minimal house price growth, and a relatively low proportion of the population aged 65 and over contribute negatively to the score. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively high at Â£44,541. Despite this, the overall score indicates that investing in care homes in Hammersmith and Fulham may not be advisable at this time. Further improvements in key areas such as house price growth and the aging population percentage could potentially make it a more viable investment opportunity in the future.
