The Local Authority District of Hammersmith and Fulham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 18.84, placing it in the Avoid category. This score is influenced by several key factors. While the district has a high percentage of care homes rated as Good by the Care Quality Commission, the overall proportion of homes requiring improvement is notably low. However, the negative impact of low house price growth, a relatively small population aged 65 and over, and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents contribute to the lower investment potential. Due to these factors, Hammersmith and Fulham is currently not recommended for investment. Further improvements in areas such as house price growth and the availability of care homes could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
