Hammersmith and Fulham's estimated care home investment potential score of -0.69 can be attributed to several key factors. While the area boasts a high percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong quality of care provision, the relatively low percentage of homes requiring improvement suggests a lack of potential for significant improvement in this aspect. Additionally, the modest house price growth and a relatively low proportion of residents aged 65 and over may indicate a stable but potentially limited market for care home investments. On a positive note, the area's Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is relatively high, suggesting a population with greater potential spending power for care services. However, the lower percentage of older residents could pose a risk in terms of demand for care services in the future. Overall, while Hammersmith and Fulham has strengths in care quality and income levels, its weaknesses in demographic trends and housing market growth may have contributed to its negative investment potential score.
