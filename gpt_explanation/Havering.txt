The investment potential score of 3.94 for Havering, as determined by the estimated care home investment potential, reflects a mixed profile. The district's relatively low percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' or 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is a positive factor, indicating a higher quality of care provision. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' and the relatively lower percentage rated as 'Outstanding' suggest room for improvement in achieving top-tier care standards. The older population in Havering may present opportunities for care home investments, given the growing demand for senior care services. On the other hand, the lower proportion of residents aged 65 and over could potentially limit the immediate market size for care homes. The positive house price growth in the area is a favorable indicator for potential property investment returns. Overall, while Havering shows promise for care home investments with its quality care facilities and market potential driven by demographic trends and property market performance, there are areas where enhancements could further elevate its investment appeal, such as striving for more 'Outstanding' CQC ratings and addressing the aging population dynamics.
