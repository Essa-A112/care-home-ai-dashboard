The Local Authority District of North Devon has a relatively high estimated care home investment potential score of 11.36, which can be attributed to several key factors. The strong house price growth percentage indicates a robust and growing local housing market, which could support demand for care home services. Additionally, the significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and over suggests a potentially higher demand for care facilities in the area. The favorable ratings from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), particularly the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good," further enhance the attractiveness of investing in care homes in North Devon. However, the presence of a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement highlights a potential area of concern that investors should address. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Outstanding" could pose a competitive disadvantage compared to areas with higher-rated facilities. Overall, while North Devon presents strong investment potential in the care home sector, investors should carefully consider and mitigate the risks associated with the need for improvement in some care homes and the limited number of outstanding facilities in the region.
