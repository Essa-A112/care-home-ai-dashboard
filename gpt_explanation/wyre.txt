The Local Authority District of Wyre has shown a mixed profile in terms of care home investment potential. With an estimated score of 38.59, falling into the "Consider" category, Wyre exhibits both strengths and weaknesses. The relatively low percentage of care homes rated as "Inadequate" at 4.65% and a healthy House Price Growth of 10.9% suggest a positive outlook. Additionally, a significant portion of the population aged 65 and above at 28.24% indicates a potential demand for care services. However, the presence of 11.63% of care homes requiring improvement and a high percentage of homes rated as "Good" at 79.07% may indicate saturation or stiff competition in the market. While there are opportunities for growth and investment in Wyre, the need for improvements and the competitive landscape suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, considering the current score, Wyre may be suitable for investment after careful considerations and improvements to enhance its overall care home sector.
