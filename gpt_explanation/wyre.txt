The Local Authority District of Wyre has a care home investment potential score of 7.20, indicating a promising opportunity for investment in the care home sector. One of the district's notable strengths is its high percentage of good CQC ratings at 79.07%, showcasing a strong track record of quality care provision. Additionally, with a relatively low percentage of inadequate CQC ratings at 4.65%, Wyre demonstrates a commitment to maintaining high standards in its care homes. The presence of 3.68 care homes per 10,000 residents suggests a sufficient infrastructure to support the aging population, further enhancing its investment appeal. However, the district does have room for improvement as evidenced by the 11.63% of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments. Despite this weakness, the substantial proportion of individuals aged 65 and above at 28.24% presents a significant advantage for potential care home investors, indicating a growing demand for elderly care services. It is important to monitor and address the issues identified by the CQC to mitigate any associated risks and capitalize on the district's favorable demographic trends for a successful investment strategy in the care home sector.
