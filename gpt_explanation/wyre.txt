The Local Authority District of Wyre has demonstrated a moderate care home investment potential score of 7.20, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Wyre benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement, standing at 11.63%, which is a positive indicator. Moreover, the district boasts a higher percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 28.24%, indicating a potentially greater demand for care services. Additionally, with 3.68 care homes per 10,000 population and a substantial 79.07% of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC, there is a solid infrastructure in place. However, the presence of 4.65% of care homes rated as "Inadequate" poses a slight risk. Overall, while Wyre falls within the range for potential investment consideration, improvements in the underperforming care homes could elevate its attractiveness for investment.
