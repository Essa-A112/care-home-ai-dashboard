The Local Authority District of Bedford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 37.47, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Bedford performs well in terms of the percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 67.74%, indicating a relatively high standard of care provision. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is favorable, suggesting good availability of care services. However, Bedford faces challenges such as a lower house price growth rate of -8.01% and a higher percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 17.23%. These factors could impact the financial viability of care home investments in the area. While there are strengths in care quality and availability, the lower house price growth and higher elderly population percentage may require careful consideration. Therefore, Bedford could be suitable for investment with some improvements to address the identified weaknesses and risks, particularly in adjusting to the demographic challenges presented.
