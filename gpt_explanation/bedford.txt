The Local Authority District of Bedford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.40, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This assessment is primarily influenced by several key factors. While Bedford exhibits a relatively high percentage of care homes with a "Good" rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 67.74% and a moderate level of homes requiring improvement at 24.73%, the negative impact of a declining house price growth of -3.19% and a lower proportion of the population aged 65 and above at 17.23% have contributed to its overall lower investment potential score. On a positive note, the district boasts a healthy number of care homes per 10,000 people at 4.90. Given its current profile, Bedford does not meet the criteria for investment suitability. However, with potential improvements in house price growth and demographic shifts, there may be opportunities for reconsideration in the future.
