The Local Authority District of York has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 48.95, placing it in the 'Good' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. York exhibits a strong House Price Growth percentage of 44.73%, indicating a healthy property market that could attract potential investors. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 22.5% suggests a higher quality of existing care facilities in the area. However, a higher proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 72.5% may pose some competition for new investments. The General Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is also favorable at Â£21,981, indicating potential spending capacity for care services. With no care homes rated as 'Inadequate', York presents a stable foundation for investment. Therefore, this LAD is deemed suitable for investment, given its overall positive indicators and growth potential in the care home sector.
