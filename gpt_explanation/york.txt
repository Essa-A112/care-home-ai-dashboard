The Local Authority District of York appears to have a promising care home investment potential score of 12.55, primarily due to several key positive attributes. The significant house price growth of over 30% suggests a thriving property market, making it potentially lucrative for real estate investments. Moreover, a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 72.5% indicates a strong overall quality of care services within the district. The above-average Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head further underscores the economic stability and potential affordability of care services for residents. Additionally, with a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 19.28%, there may be opportunities for growth in the demand for care services as the population ages in the future. However, the presence of 22.5% of CQC-rated care homes requiring improvement highlights a potential area of concern that investors should address to ensure the ongoing quality and reputation of care facilities in York. It is essential for investors to consider these factors carefully to make informed decisions and mitigate any associated risks in the care home investment market within this district.
