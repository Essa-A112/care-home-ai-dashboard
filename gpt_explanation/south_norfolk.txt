The investment potential score for South Norfolk, standing at 40.29, places it within the "Consider" category. Several key features influence this rating. The district exhibits a robust House Price Growth percentage of 14.45%, indicating a positive trend for property values. However, there are areas that warrant attention; notably, a concerning percentage of CQC ratings that require improvement at 13.64% and a lower percentage of CQC Good ratings at 79.55%. The aging population, represented by a significant 24.56% of those aged 65 and above, suggests a potential demand for care services. Considering these factors, South Norfolk falls into a range where investment could be beneficial after addressing the CQC performance indicators. While not immediately ideal for investment, with targeted improvements, this district could offer promising opportunities for the care home sector in the future.
