The South Norfolk Local Authority District has been evaluated with an estimated care home investment potential score of 8.65, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district exhibits a healthy House Price Growth percentage of 13.19% and a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 24.56%, indicating a potentially strong demand for care services. However, challenges are evident with a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 13.64%. Furthermore, the percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC is lower at 79.55%, although there is room for improvement with 2.27% rated as "Outstanding". Overall, while South Norfolk shows promise with growth opportunities, the need for enhancements in care quality and facilities suggests that it may be a suitable investment opportunity after improvements are made.
