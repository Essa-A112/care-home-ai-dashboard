Rossendale has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 12.45, placing it in the "Good" category. The district's strong points include a notable house price growth of 29.62%, a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 22.58%, a sizable total population of 71,541, and a healthy ratio of 4.33 care homes per 10,000 residents. These factors indicate a growing demand for care services and a positive environment for investment. However, the absence of any inadequate CQC ratings may also suggest a lack of underperforming care homes that could potentially be improved upon. Overall, Rossendale's favorable metrics position it as a suitable candidate for investment, offering opportunities for growth and development in the care home sector.
