The Local Authority District of High Peak has shown promising care home investment potential with a score of 59.37, categorizing it as 'Good'. This is primarily attributed to its positive indicators such as a high percentage of CQC Good ratings at 42.31% and a significant total population of 91,569. Moreover, the strong house price growth of 13.96% adds to its appeal for potential investors. However, the district does have areas for improvement, notably the 50% of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC assessments. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC Outstanding ratings at 7.69% poses a slight risk. Despite these factors, the overall positive metrics suggest that High Peak is suitable for investment, offering a favorable environment for care home development and potential returns for investors.
