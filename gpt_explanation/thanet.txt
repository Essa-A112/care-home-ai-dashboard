The investment potential score for Thanet is 36.43, placing it in the 'Avoid' category for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the area has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which suggests a potential demand for care services. Additionally, the growth in house prices indicates a degree of economic stability. However, challenges exist as well. The notably low percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is a concern, along with the presence of a significant portion requiring improvement. These factors suggest potential quality issues in the local care homes. Overall, while there are some strengths such as demographic demand and economic stability, the current quality of care homes in Thanet poses a significant risk for investment. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in this area until improvements are made to raise the standard of care provided.
