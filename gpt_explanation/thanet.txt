The Local Authority District of Thanet has demonstrated a moderate care home investment potential score of 6.98, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Notably, Thanet benefits from a healthy House Price Growth percentage of 9.63%, indicating a positive trend in property values. Additionally, the relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 23.99% suggests a potentially stable demand for care services. However, challenges exist as reflected in the percentage of care homes requiring improvement by CQC at 16.67% and a lower percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 78.33%, indicating room for enhancement in care quality. Despite these weaknesses, the district's Care Homes per 10k value of 4.27 showcases a competitive landscape for care home provision. Overall, while Thanet may not be an immediate top-tier investment choice, its potential for growth and demand signals that with strategic improvements, it could become a more attractive investment opportunity in the future.
