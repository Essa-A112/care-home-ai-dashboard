The Local Authority District of Bristol, City of, received a relatively low care home investment potential score of -0.95, primarily due to several key factors. The district exhibits a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a strong existing care infrastructure. However, the relatively low percentage of care homes needing improvement, coupled with a lower proportion of elderly residents aged 65 and above, may suggest limited immediate demand growth for care services. Additionally, the moderate house price growth rate and the large total population size could pose challenges for potential care home investors in achieving high returns on investment. While Bristol boasts a robust care quality framework and a diverse population, the subdued demand indicators and market conditions may present risks for investors seeking significant growth opportunities in the care home sector within the district.
