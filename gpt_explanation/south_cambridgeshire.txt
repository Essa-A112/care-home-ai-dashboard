The Local Authority District of South Cambridgeshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.02, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This low score is primarily influenced by several key factors. The district has a notably low percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), at 84.85%, which may raise concerns about the overall quality of care facilities. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, at 19.78%, suggests a potentially limited demand for care services in the area. Furthermore, the modest house price growth rate of 4.74% indicates a less favorable economic environment for property investment. While South Cambridgeshire does have a decent proportion of care homes rated as "Outstanding" by the CQC, at 15.15%, this positive aspect is outweighed by the other factors contributing to the low investment potential score. Overall, due to these factors, South Cambridgeshire is deemed unsuitable for investment at this time, and potential investors may need to consider alternative locations with more promising indicators for care home investments.
