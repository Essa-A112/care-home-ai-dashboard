The Local Authority District of Slough has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.98, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. One of its strengths is the relatively high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of "Good" at 64.29%, indicating a good standard of care provision. However, there are areas for improvement, such as the percentage of homes requiring improvement at 35.71%, suggesting some quality issues that need addressing. Additionally, the negative house price growth of -10.01% and a relatively low percentage of population aged 65 and over at 9.97% pose challenges for potential profitability. Overall, while Slough shows potential for investment with some enhancements, particularly in care home quality improvement, further analysis and strategic planning are advisable before making investment decisions in this district.
