The Local Authority District of Slough has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.69, categorizing it as falling into the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key features. Slough displays a negative impact on House Price Growth, with a decrease of 6.33%, which may pose challenges for investment returns. Additionally, the low percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 9.97% could limit the demand for care home services in the area. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 64.29% and the moderate percentage requiring improvement at 35.71% indicate opportunities for enhancement in the care home sector. The low number of care homes per 10,000 population further suggests room for potential growth in the care home market in Slough. Given the overall score and feature values, Slough is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment. However, with improvements in house price growth and the elderly population percentage, coupled with the existing positive CQC ratings, Slough could become a more viable option for investment in the future.
