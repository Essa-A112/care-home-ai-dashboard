The Local Authority District of North East Derbyshire has shown promising attributes in its care home investment potential score of 11.05, placing it within the "Consider" category. The district exhibits strengths in its high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 66.67%, indicating a strong quality of care provision, complemented by a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 33.33%. Furthermore, with 24.83% of its population aged 65 and above, there is a clear demand for elderly care services. However, a potential drawback lies in the moderate house price growth rate of 5.58%, which could impact investment returns. Despite the absence of 'Outstanding' rated care homes, North East Derbyshire presents a balanced profile for consideration. While not yet ideal for immediate investment due to its score falling below the 11.7 threshold, the district shows potential for future growth with targeted improvements, making it a viable candidate for investment after necessary enhancements are made.
