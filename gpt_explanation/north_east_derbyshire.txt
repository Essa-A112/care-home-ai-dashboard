North East Derbyshire has an estimated care home investment potential score of 47.66, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district has a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate or requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), with no homes falling into these categories. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is significant, indicating a potential demand for care services. The presence of care homes per 10,000 population is also relatively high, suggesting existing infrastructure to support investment. However, the lack of care homes rated as outstanding by the CQC may pose a challenge in terms of quality differentiation. Overall, while North East Derbyshire shows promise for investment due to its favorable CQC ratings and demographic profile, there may be room for improvement to enhance the quality of care facilities and potentially elevate its investment potential further.
