The Local Authority District of Fareham has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 10.94, driven by several key factors. Firstly, the strong house price growth percentage indicates a healthy local economy and potentially higher affordability for care home services. The relatively low percentage of CQC requiring improvement suggests a higher quality of existing care homes in the area, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, with over a quarter of the population aged 65 and above, there is a significant demand for elderly care services. The high GDHI per head further supports the notion that residents may have the financial means to afford premium care services. Lastly, the above-average number of care homes per 10,000 people indicates a competitive market, which could be both a strength and a risk depending on market saturation and pricing dynamics. Overall, Fareham's favorable demographic profile and economic indicators position it as a promising location for investing in care home facilities.
