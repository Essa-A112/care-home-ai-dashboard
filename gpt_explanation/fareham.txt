The Local Authority District of Fareham has an estimated care home investment potential score of 43.79, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Fareham benefits from a low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), indicating a high standard of care provision. Additionally, the significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and over suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. On the other hand, the relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the CQC could indicate a competitive market. Furthermore, the moderate percentage of homes requiring improvement may point to areas needing attention to enhance overall care quality. While Fareham falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, it presents promising aspects that could be further leveraged with targeted improvements. Therefore, with strategic enhancements, Fareham may transition into a more favorable investment opportunity in the future.
