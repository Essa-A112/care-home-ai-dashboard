The investment potential score of -0.36 for Haringey suggests a moderate negative outlook for care home investment in this Local Authority District. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. The relatively low House Price Growth percentage and the high proportion of care homes rated as requiring improvement by the CQC indicate potential challenges in the local care home market. Additionally, the percentage of the population aged 65 and above being relatively low could limit the demand for care home services. On the positive side, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head is a strength, indicating a higher potential for residents to afford care services. However, this may not be sufficient to offset the other negative factors. Investors should be cautious about the potential risks associated with investing in care homes in Haringey, considering the demographic trends and quality of existing care facilities.
