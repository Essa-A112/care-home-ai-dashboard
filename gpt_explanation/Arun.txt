The Local Authority District of Arun has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 11.21, largely influenced by several key features. With a robust House Price Growth percentage of 15.36%, it indicates a healthy real estate market that can attract investors. The relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 28.82% suggests a growing demand for care services in the area. Additionally, the above-average number of care homes per 10,000 people indicates an existing infrastructure to support such investments. A notable strength lies in the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022, standing at Â£23,068, indicating a financially stable population potentially able to afford care services. However, the percentage of Care Quality Commission rated 'Good' at 76.42% poses a slight weakness, suggesting room for improvement in care home quality standards. Investors should consider this aspect when evaluating the overall investment landscape in Arun.
