The Local Authority District of Windsor and Maidenhead has a high estimated care home investment potential score of 8.96, primarily attributed to several key factors. The district boasts a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 58.14%, indicating a strong quality of care provision. Additionally, with a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 25.58%, Windsor and Maidenhead demonstrates a commitment to maintaining high standards in the care sector. The area's Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022 is also notably high at 34929, showcasing a potentially affluent demographic that may be willing to invest in quality care services. However, the district does face challenges, such as a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' by the CQC at 16.28%, potentially indicating fierce competition in the market. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth could pose a risk, potentially affecting the affordability of care services and investment opportunities in the area. Overall, while Windsor and Maidenhead presents strengths in quality care provision and economic indicators, careful consideration of market saturation and economic factors is crucial in assessing its investment potential.
