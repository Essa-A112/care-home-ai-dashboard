The Local Authority District of Windsor and Maidenhead has demonstrated a promising care home investment potential with an estimated score of 8.96, placing it within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced positively by key factors such as a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 58.14% and a favorable GDHI per head in 2022 at 34929. However, there are areas for improvement, including a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 25.58% and a slightly lower percentage rated as "Outstanding" at 16.28%. Additionally, the house price growth percentage of 6.88 poses a negative impact on the overall score. While Windsor and Maidenhead shows promise for investment, it may benefit from enhancements in CQC ratings and addressing property market trends to further solidify its attractiveness for care home investments.
