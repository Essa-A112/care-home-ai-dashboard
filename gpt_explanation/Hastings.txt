The Local Authority District of Hastings has a strong investment potential in the care home sector with a score of 10.87, driven by several key factors. The significant positive house price growth of 19.22% indicates a robust local property market, which can positively impact care home investments. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of CQC inspections requiring improvement at 22.54% reflects a commitment to quality care services. The high percentage of CQC-rated good care homes at 76.06% is a potential area for improvement to attract more investment. The relatively high percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 20.8% suggests a growing demand for care services in the area. With a high number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 7.82, there is already a supportive infrastructure in place. However, potential risks could include saturation in the care home market if not managed effectively, while the aging population presents a long-term opportunity for sustained demand in the sector.
