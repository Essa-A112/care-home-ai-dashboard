The investment potential score for Middlesbrough, with a rating of 27.93, places it in the 'Avoid' category for care home investment. Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Middlesbrough has a high percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to CQC ratings, coupled with a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and above. Additionally, the negative house price growth and a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes further impact its investment potential. On a positive note, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is relatively high, indicating some existing infrastructure. However, the overall combination of these factors suggests a challenging environment for care home investments in Middlesbrough. Given the current conditions, it is advisable to avoid investing in this area until significant improvements are made to key indicators.
