The Local Authority District of Middlesbrough has been assessed with a care home investment potential score of -0.67, indicating a lower potential for investment in this area. Several key features contribute to this assessment. Middlesbrough exhibits a decline in house price growth, which can impact the overall investment attractiveness. Additionally, a notable percentage of care services in the area require improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which may raise concerns for potential investors. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over could limit the demand for care home services. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in Middlesbrough is relatively modest, potentially affecting the affordability of care services. However, a strength lies in the high percentage of care services rated as 'Good' by the CQC, indicating a level of quality in existing care facilities. Despite this, the overall lower scores in key indicators suggest some risks and challenges for investors looking into the care home sector in Middlesbrough.
