The Local Authority District of Middlesbrough has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -0.67, categorizing it as one to avoid in terms of investment. Several key features contribute to this score, including a decline in House Price Growth, a notable percentage of properties requiring improvement according to the CQC, a relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and over, and a modest Gross Disposable Household Income per capita. While the district boasts a high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes, the overall negative impact of the aforementioned factors suggests a challenging environment for care home investment in Middlesbrough. Given the score falls below the threshold for consideration, it is advisable to refrain from investing in this area at present.
