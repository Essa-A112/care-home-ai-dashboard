West Lancashire has a promising care home investment potential score of 14.57, largely influenced by its positive key features. The district shows robust House Price Growth at nearly 24%, indicating a strong real estate market that could attract investment. Moreover, with over 60% of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and relatively low percentages for 'Requires Improvement' and 'Inadequate', it suggests a high standard of care facilities. The significant proportion of residents aged 65 and above at 22.42% also signals a potentially growing demand for care services. However, there may be some risks associated with the aging population, such as increased strain on healthcare resources. Overall, West Lancashire presents itself as a favorable location for care home investment, with strengths in property growth, quality care services, and a demographic trend that supports the sector's growth.
