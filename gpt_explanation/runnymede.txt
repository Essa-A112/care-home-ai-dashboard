The Local Authority District of Runnymede has an estimated care home investment potential score of 25.90, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the district has a relatively sizable total population of 90,442, indicating a potential demand for care services, the negative impacts of a significant House Price Growth decrease of -26.58% and a high percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement at 15.79% outweigh this positive aspect. Additionally, the lack of any CQC-rated Inadequate care homes in the area is a strength. However, the dominance of Good-rated care homes at 84.21% may suggest limited room for improvement or investment opportunities. Considering the overall score falls below the investment threshold, Runnymede is currently not deemed suitable for care home investment. Further development and improvement in housing market conditions and CQC ratings could potentially shift its investment potential in the future.
