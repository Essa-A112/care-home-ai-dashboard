The investment potential score of -1.63 for Runnymede suggests that the care home investment outlook in this Local Authority District may face challenges. The negative impact on the score is primarily driven by the significant decline in House Price Growth, indicating potential economic pressures in the area. Additionally, the relatively low proportion of care homes rated as CQC Good or requiring improvement raises concerns about the quality of existing facilities. The aging population, although a positive factor for care home demand, is somewhat offset by the relatively lower percentage of individuals aged 65 and above. However, the district's sizable total population could present opportunities for care home operators to cater to a diverse demographic. Despite these strengths, the overall negative score reflects risks associated with economic conditions, quality of care homes, and demographic factors that could impact the success of care home investments in Runnymede.
