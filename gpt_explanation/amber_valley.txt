Amber Valley has shown strong potential for care home investment with a score of 8.81, primarily driven by its robust house price growth of 16.78%. The significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 23.04% suggests a growing elderly population, indicating a potential demand for care services. However, the relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 18.18% and the lower percentage of homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 77.27% could pose challenges in maintaining high-quality care standards. Additionally, the lower Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 at Â£20,715 may impact the affordability of care services for residents. Despite these weaknesses, the positive demographic trend and strong house price growth indicate opportunities for investment in the care home sector in Amber Valley, although careful attention should be paid to improving care quality and addressing income constraints to mitigate risks and capitalize on the district's advantages.
