The Local Authority District of Amber Valley has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 8.81, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The district benefits from a significant House Price Growth percentage of 16.78%, indicating a potentially strong economic environment for investment. Additionally, a relatively high percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 23.04% suggests a potential demand for care services. However, Amber Valley faces challenges such as a notable percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 18.18% and a lower percentage of CQC-rated Good care homes at 77.27%. Moreover, the GDHI per head in 2022 is relatively low at 20715, indicating potential financial constraints. While the district shows promise for investment, there are areas that require improvement to maximize returns. Therefore, with careful consideration and potential enhancements in care quality and economic indicators, Amber Valley could be a suitable location for investment in the future.
