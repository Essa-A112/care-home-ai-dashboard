The Local Authority District of Walsall has an estimated care home investment potential score of 38.71, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score reflects a mixed profile with both strengths and areas for improvement. Walsall performs well in terms of the percentage of care homes rated as "Requires Improvement" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is at a low 25.0%. However, the relatively low percentage of homes rated as "Good" at 71.88% and a moderate house price growth of 5.68% present challenges. The demographic composition, with 17.45% of the population being 65 or older, suggests a potential demand for care services. While there are no care homes rated as "Inadequate," the overall score indicates room for enhancement. Walsall falls slightly below the threshold for direct investment suitability, suggesting that with targeted improvements, it could become a more attractive investment option. Further assessment and potential interventions could help elevate Walsall to a more favorable investment status.
