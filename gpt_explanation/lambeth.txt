The care home investment potential score for Lambeth, standing at 0.31, places it in the "Avoid" category. This rating is influenced by several key factors. Lambeth exhibits a negative impact on house price growth and a relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and over, indicating potential challenges in attracting elderly residents. However, the area boasts a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, which is a positive indicator. Moreover, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively high, suggesting a potential market for premium care services. Despite these strengths, the overall score falls below the threshold for investment suitability, primarily due to the low house price growth and percentage of elderly residents. Therefore, Lambeth is deemed unsuitable for investment at present, but improvements in the housing market and demographic composition could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
