The Local Authority District of Lambeth has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of 31.15, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. While the percentage of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is relatively high at 73.68%, the negative impact of a significant House Price Growth decrease of -19.39% and a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 9.25% have contributed to the lower score. Additionally, the presence of only 1.20 care homes per 10,000 people in the district further detracts from its investment potential. Given these factors, Lambeth may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in house price growth, an increase in the elderly population percentage, and a higher number of care homes per capita could potentially enhance its investment appeal in the future.
