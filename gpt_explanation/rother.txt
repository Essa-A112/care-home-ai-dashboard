The Local Authority District of Rother has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of 10.07, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Rother shows a robust House Price Growth of 18.11%, indicating a healthy housing market that could support care home investments. However, the percentages of CQC ratings, with 8.7% requiring improvement and 91.3% rated as good, suggest a mixed quality of existing care services. The demographic composition, with 32.52% aged 65 and over, signals a potential demand for care facilities. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is Â£24,725, indicating a reasonably affluent population. While Rother falls short of the threshold for direct investment suitability, its favorable demographics and economic indicators suggest potential for investment after improvements to existing care services. Careful consideration should be given to enhancing care quality to fully capitalize on the district's investment potential.
