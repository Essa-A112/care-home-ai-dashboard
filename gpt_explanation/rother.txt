The Local Authority District of Rother has an estimated care home investment potential score of 39.31, placing it in the 'Consider' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Rother exhibits a strong positive house price growth of 22.89%, indicating a potentially favorable market for property investment. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 years and above is significant at 32.52%, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, the presence of 8.7% of care homes requiring improvement and a high percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' facilities at 91.3% indicate areas of concern in care quality. Despite these challenges, with 7.27 care homes per 10,000 population, there is an existing infrastructure to support the care sector. While Rother falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its promising house price growth and demographic trends suggest that with targeted improvements in care quality, it could become a viable investment opportunity in the future.
