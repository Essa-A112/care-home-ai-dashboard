The Local Authority District of Ealing has an estimated care home investment potential score of 3.19, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment. This assessment is influenced by several key factors. Ealing exhibits a negative impact on the House Price Growth percentage, indicating a declining property market that may deter potential investors. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over, coupled with a below-average total population, suggests a smaller target demographic for care home services. On a positive note, the district boasts a significant proportion of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission, indicating quality service provision. However, the presence of a notable percentage of establishments requiring improvement poses a risk to overall care home standards. Given these considerations, Ealing's current investment potential falls below the recommended threshold, suggesting that it may not be an ideal location for care home investments at present.
