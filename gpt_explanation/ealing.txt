The Local Authority District of Ealing has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.97, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Ealing exhibits a negative house price growth of -13.87%, indicating a potential lack of economic growth in the area. Moreover, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and above is relatively low at 12.61%, potentially limiting the demand for care home services. Additionally, the presence of a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 people, coupled with a significant percentage of CQC ratings requiring improvement at 25.0% and a high percentage of CQC ratings at 'Good' at 75.0%, suggests a competitive market with room for enhancement in service quality. Given these factors, Ealing may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present, with potential opportunities for improvement in the future to make it a more attractive investment prospect.
