Broxbourne, with an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.10, presents a mixed profile for potential investors. The district shows strengths in its relatively high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes at 66.67%, indicating a solid quality of care provision. However, this is offset by a lower percentage of "Outstanding" CQC-rated facilities at 13.33%, suggesting room for improvement in some areas. Broxbourne's House Price Growth % is slightly negative, potentially impacting investment returns. The relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 plus at 17.52% may limit the immediate demand for care services. Additionally, the number of care homes per 10,000 residents is on the lower side, indicating potential saturation in the market. Investors should carefully consider these factors to assess the overall risk and advantages of investing in care homes in Broxbourne.
