East Suffolk has an estimated care home investment potential score of 34.11, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district boasts a healthy House Price Growth of 9.05% and a significant proportion of residents aged 65 and over at 28.72%. However, these strengths are somewhat offset by a relatively high percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 11.69% and a similar percentage not achieving an "Outstanding" rating. While there are no inadequate care homes in the area, the need for improvement in a significant portion of existing facilities indicates potential risks for investors. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, East Suffolk is currently deemed unsuitable for direct investment. Further enhancements in care home quality and performance could potentially shift its classification to one that may be considered for investment in the future.
