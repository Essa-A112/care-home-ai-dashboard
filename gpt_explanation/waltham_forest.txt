The Local Authority District of Waltham Forest has an estimated care home investment potential score of 20.66, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Waltham Forest exhibits a high percentage of properties requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), along with a notable decline in house price growth. Despite a significant proportion of care homes being rated as "Good" by the CQC, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65 and above may impact the demand for care services. With a total population of 275,980, the district faces challenges in catering to potential care home residents. Given these factors, investing in care homes in Waltham Forest may not be advisable at present due to the overall lower investment potential score. Additional improvements in various areas such as property conditions and demographic trends could potentially make this district more suitable for investment in the future.
