The Local Authority District of Waltham Forest has an estimated care home investment potential score of 0.33, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. This low score can be attributed to several key factors. Waltham Forest exhibits a relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes at 91.3%, coupled with a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement at 6.52%. Moreover, the district's elderly population percentage is relatively low at 10.69%, potentially indicating a lower demand for care services. Additionally, the house price growth rate in Waltham Forest is modest at 6.73%, suggesting limited potential for property value appreciation. With a total population of 275,980, the market size for care services may be relatively constrained. Considering these factors collectively, Waltham Forest may not currently offer a favorable environment for care home investment. Further improvements in care home quality and market conditions may enhance its investment potential in the future.
