The Local Authority District of Lichfield has a moderate care home investment potential score of 4.89, influenced by several key factors. The area exhibits a slightly negative House Price Growth percentage, indicating some level of economic instability. However, the relatively high percentage of CQC-rated Good care homes at 68.97% suggests a strong infrastructure for elderly care. The presence of a significant 23.93% 65-plus population further supports the demand for care services. Yet, the relatively high percentage of CQC-Requiring Improvement facilities at 31.03% highlights potential quality concerns that investors should address. While there are no CQC-rated Outstanding care homes in the area, this could also present an opportunity for investors to improve and expand premium care services. Overall, Lichfield offers a balanced investment landscape with strengths in care infrastructure and demand, but investors should remain vigilant of quality issues and consider strategies to capitalize on growth potential.
