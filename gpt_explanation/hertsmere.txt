The Local Authority District of Hertsmere has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.14, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Hertsmere exhibits a slight decline in house price growth, which may deter potential investors. However, the district boasts a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission, indicating a strong quality of care provision. On the other hand, a lower percentage of care homes with an "Outstanding" rating and a moderate proportion of residents aged 65 and over could pose challenges for investment attractiveness. With a GDHI per head above the national average, there is potential for improvement. Overall, Hertsmere's current score suggests that it may not be the most favorable location for care home investment without significant enhancements to address the identified weaknesses and risks.
