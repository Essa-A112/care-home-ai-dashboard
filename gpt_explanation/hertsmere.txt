The Local Authority District of Hertsmere has an estimated care home investment potential score of 35.21, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Hertsmere exhibits a slight decline in house price growth, indicating a less favorable market environment for property investments. However, the area shows promise with a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per capita in Hertsmere is relatively high, suggesting potential demand for quality care services. On the other hand, the percentage of care homes rated as 'Outstanding' is lower, which could pose a challenge in attracting discerning clientele. With no care homes rated as 'Inadequate,' the area demonstrates a basic level of care quality assurance. Overall, Hertsmere falls below the threshold for immediate investment suitability. However, with improvements in key areas like house price growth and CQC ratings, it could become a viable option for investment in the future.
