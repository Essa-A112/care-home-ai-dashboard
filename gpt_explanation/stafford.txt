The Local Authority District of Stafford has shown promising indicators in its care home investment potential score of 47.07, placing it in the "Consider" category. Stafford benefits from a relatively low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 0.0%, indicating a strong foundation in care quality. Moreover, with over 63% of care homes in the district rated as "Good" by the CQC, there is a notable commitment to providing high-quality care services. The significant percentage of individuals aged 65 and above at 23.2% suggests a potential demand for care services in the area. Additionally, the healthy house price growth of 14.71% adds to the overall attractiveness of the investment potential. However, Stafford also faces challenges with a moderate percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the CQC at 30.43%.
