The Local Authority District of Stafford has shown promising potential for care home investment with an estimated score of 11.19, falling within the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Stafford exhibits positive house price growth, a high percentage of CQC Good-rated care homes, and a significant elderly population aged 65 and above. These aspects indicate a favorable environment for care home investments. However, there are areas requiring attention, such as the percentage of CQC Requires Improvement-rated facilities and a lower percentage of CQC Outstanding-rated homes. Despite these challenges, Stafford stands as a viable option for investment consideration, especially with the potential for improvement in CQC ratings. With strategic enhancements, Stafford could further solidify its position as an attractive location for care home investments.
