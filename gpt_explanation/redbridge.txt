The Local Authority District of Redbridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.22, placing it in the 'Avoid' category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Redbridge shows strengths in house price growth, with a positive impact on the score. However, its percentage of CQC Good-rated care homes is high, leading to a negative impact. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and above further affects the score negatively. Notably, Redbridge has no care homes rated as inadequate by the CQC. Overall, due to its score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, Redbridge is not currently recommended for care home investment. However, with potential improvements in certain areas, it may become a viable option in the future.
