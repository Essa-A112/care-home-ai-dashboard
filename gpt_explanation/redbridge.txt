The Local Authority District of Redbridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of 2.85, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Redbridge has a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is a positive indicator. However, the relatively small percentage of the population aged 65 and over, coupled with a significant proportion of the population and a lack of care homes rated as "Outstanding," contribute to the lower investment potential score. Given these factors, Redbridge may not be an ideal location for care home investment at present. Further improvements in the care home quality and an increase in the elderly population could potentially enhance its investment potential in the future.
