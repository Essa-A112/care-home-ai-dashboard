The Local Authority District of Eastleigh has a care home investment potential score of 38.75, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Eastleigh shows strengths in having a low percentage of care homes rated as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 0.0%, and a modest percentage of outstanding facilities at 2.0%. However, the relatively high percentage of homes requiring improvement at 22.0% presents a potential area for concern. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth at 6.16% and a predominant percentage of CQC-rated good facilities at 76.0% may pose challenges for investment attractiveness. While Eastleigh falls short of the threshold for immediate investment suitability, its potential for improvement in CQC ratings suggests that with targeted enhancements, it could become a more favorable investment opportunity in the future.
