Eastleigh has demonstrated a moderate care home investment potential with a score of 6.44, placing it in the "Consider" category. The district benefits from a relatively low House Price Growth percentage, indicating potential affordability for investors. Moreover, a high percentage of care homes with Good ratings and a low percentage requiring improvement suggest a generally positive quality of care in the area. With a decent number of care homes per 10,000 residents and a small percentage of outstanding ratings, there is room for growth and improvement in the care home sector in Eastleigh. However, the score falls short of the threshold for direct investment suitability, highlighting the need for further enhancements to fully capitalize on the district's potential. While Eastleigh shows promise, additional improvements in various aspects could elevate its investment appeal in the future.
