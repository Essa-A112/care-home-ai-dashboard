The Local Authority District of Tameside has shown promising potential for care home investment, with an estimated score of 15.97 categorizing it as "Good". This score reflects several key factors contributing to its attractiveness. Tameside benefits from a strong house price growth rate of 24.82%, indicating a healthy property market conducive to investment. Additionally, a significant portion of care facilities in the area have been rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), standing at 55.81%, which is a positive indicator of quality care services. Despite a relatively lower Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per head in 2022, the presence of a high percentage of facilities requiring improvement (37.21%) suggests opportunities for enhancement and potential growth in the care sector. However, it is important to note the small percentage of inadequate care facilities (4.65%), which poses a risk that should be monitored closely. Overall, Tameside's favorable house price growth, a majority of good-rated care facilities, and room for improvement make it a suitable candidate for investment, offering potential for growth and development in the care home sector.
