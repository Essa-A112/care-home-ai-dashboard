The Local Authority District of Tameside has shown a promising care home investment potential score of 56.31, categorizing it as a good investment opportunity. This score is influenced positively by several key features, including a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement at 37.21%, a high percentage of care homes rated as good at 55.81%, and a small percentage of inadequate care homes at 4.65%. Additionally, the significant house price growth of 26.36% adds to its attractiveness for investment. However, the total population of 234,666 poses a slight negative impact on the overall score. Despite this, Tameside's strengths in CQC ratings and house price growth outweigh the population factor, making it a suitable candidate for investment. With a score above the threshold for investment suitability, Tameside presents a favorable opportunity for those considering care home investments in the area.
