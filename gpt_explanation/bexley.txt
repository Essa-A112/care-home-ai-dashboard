The Local Authority District of Bexley has an estimated care home investment potential score of 5.33, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Bexley exhibits a slight decrease in house price growth percentage, which may deter potential investors. Additionally, with only 71.88% of care homes rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), there is room for improvement in the overall quality of care provided. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over at 16.64% and a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents could suggest limited demand for additional care facilities in the area. While the presence of a low percentage of care homes rated as "Inadequate" at 6.25% is a positive aspect, the overall profile indicates a less favorable environment for care home investments in Bexley. Given these considerations, it is advisable to avoid investing in this LAD without significant improvements to enhance its investment potential.
