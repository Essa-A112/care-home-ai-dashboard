The Local Authority District of Leeds has a care home investment potential score of 6.63, indicating a moderate level of attractiveness for investment. This score is influenced by various key features of the area. Leeds has a relatively low percentage of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission, which is a positive indicator for potential investors. Additionally, a significant portion of care homes in the district have been rated as 'good' by the CQC, further enhancing its appeal. However, Leeds faces challenges such as a higher percentage of residents aged 65 and above, which may strain care home resources. The GDHI per head and total population figures are also on the lower side, signaling potential economic constraints and a smaller market size for care home services. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the investment potential in the care home sector in Leeds, weighing the strengths against the weaknesses to make informed decisions and mitigate risks.
