The Local Authority District of Hackney has been assigned an estimated care home investment potential score of -1.05, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Hackney exhibits a negative house price growth percentage, indicating a potential lack of investment attractiveness in the housing market. Moreover, the relatively low percentage of CQC-rated 'Good' care homes, coupled with a higher proportion of care homes requiring improvement, suggests challenges in maintaining high-quality care services. Additionally, the small percentage of population aged 65 and over may limit the demand for care services in the area. With a low number of care homes per 10,000 residents, there may be limited opportunities for care home development. Given these factors, Hackney is deemed unsuitable for investment at present, highlighting the need for significant improvements to enhance its investment potential.
