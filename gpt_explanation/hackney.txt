The Local Authority District of Hackney has shown an estimated care home investment potential score of 22.86, placing it in the "Avoid" category for investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. Hackney exhibits a negative House Price Growth percentage, indicating a potential downturn in property values. Moreover, a notable percentage of care homes in the area require improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), suggesting room for enhancement in care quality. Additionally, the relatively low proportion of individuals aged 65 and over, coupled with a low number of care homes per 10,000 residents, may pose challenges in catering to the potential future demand for elderly care services. While Hackney boasts a high percentage of CQC-rated "Good" care homes, indicating quality services in some facilities, the overall profile suggests areas of concern that may impact investment viability. Given the current assessment, Hackney is deemed unsuitable for immediate investment, with potential considerations for improvement strategies to enhance its attractiveness for future investment opportunities.
