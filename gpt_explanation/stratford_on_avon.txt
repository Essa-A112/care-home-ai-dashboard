The Local Authority District of Stratford-on-Avon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 4.32, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively high at 25.53%, indicating a potential demand for care services. Additionally, the Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is at a healthy level of 29741, suggesting a certain level of affordability within the community. However, there are notable weaknesses that contribute to the low score. The negative House Price Growth percentage of -4.77 indicates a potential lack of property value appreciation, which could impact investment returns. Moreover, the percentages of care homes requiring improvement and those rated as good by the Care Quality Commission are 14.58% and 81.25% respectively, suggesting a mixed quality landscape. Considering these factors, Stratford-on-Avon is deemed unsuitable for investment at present due to the overall lower score and associated risks. Further improvements in property value growth and CQC ratings may warrant a reconsideration in the future.
