The Local Authority District of Stratford-on-Avon has an estimated care home investment potential score of 33.36, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment purposes. This score is influenced by several key factors. On the positive side, the district has a relatively high percentage of residents aged 65 and over, which could indicate a potential demand for care home services. However, this is offset by several weaknesses. The percentage of care homes rated as 'Requires Improvement' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is notable, suggesting quality issues within the existing care facilities. Additionally, a negative house price growth rate and a high percentage of 'Good' rated care homes could indicate a saturated market with limited growth potential. Given these factors, Stratford-on-Avon is currently not deemed suitable for investment. Addressing the quality issues within existing care homes and monitoring market saturation could potentially improve its investment potential in the future.
