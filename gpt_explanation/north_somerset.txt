The investment potential score for North Somerset indicates that it falls into the "Consider" category, suggesting a moderate level of suitability for care home investment. This score is influenced by several key factors. North Somerset shows strengths in its positive house price growth of 9.7%, indicating a potentially stable economic environment. Additionally, the percentage of individuals aged 65 and over is relatively high at 24.15%, suggesting a potential demand for elderly care services. However, the district faces challenges with 14.78% of care homes requiring improvement according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), and a high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 83.48%, which could indicate a competitive market. The number of care homes per 10,000 population is above average at 5.29, which may also impact investment dynamics. Overall, while North Somerset shows promise with positive demographic trends and economic indicators, the need for improvement in care home quality suggests that investment should be approached cautiously. Further enhancements in care home standards could potentially elevate this district to a more favorable investment category in the future.
