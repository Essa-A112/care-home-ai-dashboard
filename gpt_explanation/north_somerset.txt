North Somerset has a solid estimated care home investment potential score of 7.88, driven by several key factors. The district boasts a healthy House_Price_Growth_% of 9.79%, indicating a positive trend in the real estate market which can attract investors. However, the relatively lower %_CQC_Good rating of 83.48% and higher %_CQC_RequiresImprovement of 14.78% suggest room for improvement in the quality of care homes in the area. On a positive note, the Percent_65plus of 24.15% indicates a significant portion of the population is within the target demographic for care home services. Additionally, the high Care_Homes_per_10k value of 5.29 demonstrates the existing infrastructure to support care facilities. Despite these strengths, potential investors should be wary of the need for improvements in care quality and the competitive market landscape. Overall, North Somerset presents a promising opportunity for care home investments but requires attention to quality and market dynamics to maximize returns.
