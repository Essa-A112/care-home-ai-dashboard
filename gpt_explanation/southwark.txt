The Local Authority District of Southwark has been assessed with an estimated care home investment potential score of -2.87, categorizing it as one to avoid for investment purposes. This score is influenced by several key features indicating challenges for investment. Factors such as a significant decrease in House Price Growth, a relatively low percentage of the population aged 65 and over, a high percentage of care homes with a CQC rating of Good, a large total population, and a low number of care homes per 10,000 residents all contribute negatively to the overall score. These characteristics suggest a less favorable environment for care home investments in Southwark. While the area may have strengths such as a high percentage of care homes with a Good CQC rating, the overall profile indicates notable weaknesses and risks that may not make it a suitable candidate for investment at this time.
