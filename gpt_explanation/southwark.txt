The Local Authority District of Southwark has a relatively low estimated care home investment potential score of -2.87, primarily influenced by several key features. Factors such as the significant negative house price growth rate of -22.21% and the relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 8.77% contribute to this score. Additionally, the high proportion of care homes with a CQC rating of 'Good' at 81.25%, coupled with a large total population of 315,519, may suggest that the existing care home market in Southwark is relatively saturated or well-regulated. While this can indicate a stable market, it also implies potential limited growth opportunities for new care home investments. The relatively low number of care homes per 10,000 people further supports the notion of a potentially competitive market with fewer opportunities for new entrants. Overall, Southwark's investment potential score reflects a challenging environment for care home investments, with both strengths and weaknesses influencing its desirability for potential investors.
