The Local Authority District of Southwark has an estimated care home investment potential score of 19.80, placing it in the "Avoid" category. This score is primarily influenced by several key factors. Southwark exhibits a significant decline in House Price Growth at -48.36%, a relatively low percentage of individuals aged 65 and over at 8.77%, and a limited number of care homes per 10,000 residents at 0.51. Additionally, while 81.25% of care homes in the area are rated as "Good" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), there is also a notable percentage of 18.75% categorized as "Requires Improvement." These combined factors suggest a challenging environment for care home investments in Southwark. Given the overall score falling below the threshold for investment suitability, it is advisable to avoid investing in care homes in this particular district at present.
