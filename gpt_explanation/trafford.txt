Trafford's care home investment potential score of 1.59 places it in the "Avoid" category, indicating caution for potential investors. This score is primarily influenced by factors such as a relatively low percentage of outstanding CQC-rated care homes and a higher percentage of homes requiring improvement. Additionally, the negative impact of house price growth and the percentage of residents aged 65 and over further contribute to the lower score. While Trafford does have a significant percentage of CQC-rated good care homes, these strengths are outweighed by the weaknesses observed in other key indicators. Given the overall profile, this LAD is not currently suitable for investment and would require significant improvements before being considered for investment opportunities.
