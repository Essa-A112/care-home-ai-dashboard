The Local Authority District of Trafford has an estimated care home investment potential score of 28.70, categorizing it as an area to avoid for investment. Several key features contribute to this rating. The percentage of care homes requiring improvement (12.28%) and those rated as outstanding (10.53%) are both factors that negatively impact the investment potential. Additionally, the relatively low house price growth rate (-2.83%) and a smaller percentage of the population aged 65 and above (17.72%) further diminish the attractiveness of this area for care home investment. While there are no inadequate-rated care homes in Trafford, the overall combination of these factors suggests that significant improvements would be needed to make this area more suitable for investment. As such, due to the current low investment potential score, Trafford is not recommended for immediate investment and would require substantial enhancements to become a viable option in the future.
