The investment potential score of 1.59 for Trafford suggests a moderate outlook for care home investments in the area. The relatively high percentage of care homes rated as 'Good' by the Care Quality Commission at 77.19% indicates a strong quality of care provision, potentially attracting investors. However, factors such as the moderate percentage of residents aged 65 and over at 17.72% and a low percentage of 'Outstanding' CQC-rated care homes at 10.53% may pose challenges for the market. Additionally, the negative impact from the low house price growth rate and a notable proportion of care homes requiring improvement at 12.28% could be concerning for investors, indicating potential risks in terms of property value appreciation and operational performance. Overall, while Trafford shows strengths in care quality, the aging population and housing market dynamics could present hurdles to maximizing investment returns in the care home sector.
