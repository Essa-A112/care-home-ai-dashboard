The Local Authority District of Tandridge has shown promising care home investment potential with a score of 7.28, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. The area benefits from a high percentage of CQC rated 'Good' care homes at 75.61%, indicating a strong existing care infrastructure. Additionally, a significant portion of the population being over 65 years old at 21.21% suggests a potential demand for care services. However, challenges lie in the House Price Growth percentage, which is slightly negative at 0.27%, potentially impacting property value appreciation. Moreover, the percentage of CQC requiring improvement is at 12.2%, indicating areas that may need enhancement in care quality. Despite these considerations, the area's Gross Disposable Household Income per head in 2022 is relatively healthy at Â£31,686, indicating economic stability. Overall, Tandridge's score suggests that while it has potential for investment, there are areas that may require improvement to maximize returns. Therefore, further assessment and potential enhancements could position Tandridge as a more favorable investment opportunity in the future.
