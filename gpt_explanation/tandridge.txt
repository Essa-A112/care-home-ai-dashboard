The Local Authority District of Tandridge has an estimated care home investment potential score of 40.67, placing it in the "Consider" category. This score is influenced by several key factors. Tandridge benefits from a relatively low percentage of CQC rated as inadequate care homes, which is a positive indicator. Additionally, the area has a moderate number of care homes per 10,000 residents and a reasonable percentage of individuals aged 65 and above, suggesting a potential demand for care services. However, Tandridge does have a notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement, which could affect the overall quality of care in the area. Despite this, the positive house price growth indicates a stable economic environment. Overall, while Tandridge falls short of being a top investment choice, its score suggests potential for improvement and careful consideration for investment in the future.
