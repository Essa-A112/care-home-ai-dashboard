The investment potential score of 7.28 for Tandridge suggests a promising outlook for care home investments in the area. The district's high percentage of CQC rated as 'Good' at 75.61% is a clear strength, indicating a good standard of care facilities available. Additionally, the relatively low percentage of CQC requiring improvement at 12.2% further supports the quality of care services in Tandridge. The significant percentage of residents aged 65 and above at 21.21% also signals a potentially strong demand for care services. However, challenges may arise from the negative impact of house price growth, which could affect affordability and investment returns. Overall, with a relatively high GDHI per head and favorable CQC ratings, Tandridge presents a solid investment opportunity in the care home sector, although potential risks related to housing market dynamics should be carefully considered.
