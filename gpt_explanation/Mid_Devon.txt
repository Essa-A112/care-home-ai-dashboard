The Local Authority District of Mid Devon has received a relatively high care home investment potential score of 7.66, primarily due to several key factors. The area benefits from a robust house price growth rate of 9.24%, indicating a strong local economy and potentially increasing demand for care home services. Additionally, the percentage of residents aged 65 and over is significant at 24.62%, suggesting a potentially growing market for elderly care facilities. Moreover, the high proportion of care homes with a 'Good' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) at 70.97% reflects a quality standard that can attract investors. However, there are some weaknesses to consider, such as the notable percentage of care homes requiring improvement (19.35%) and those rated as 'Outstanding' (9.68%), indicating areas where improvements may be needed. Investors should be mindful of these risks and advantages when evaluating potential opportunities in the care home sector in Mid Devon.
