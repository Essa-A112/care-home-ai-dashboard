Care home investment in the Wakefield area may present challenges with a negative ROI of -3.75%. However, the relatively high percentage of aged 65+ population at 19.07% suggests a potential demand for care services. With 71.9% of care homes rated as Good and 2.1% as Outstanding, there is a solid foundation in place for quality care provision. Overall, Wakefield's care home investment potential is worth considering, but thorough analysis and risk assessment are recommended.
