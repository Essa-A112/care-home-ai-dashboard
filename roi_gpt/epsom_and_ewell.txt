Investing in care homes in the Local Authority of Epsom and Ewell may not be the most attractive option due to the low ROI of 4.02% and the investment grade rating of "Avoid." However, with 87.5% of care homes rated as Good and 4.2% rated as Outstanding, the quality of care in the area seems relatively high. Additionally, the 18.1% of the population aged 65+ indicates a potential demand for care services in the future. It's important to carefully consider these factors before making an investment decision.
