Investing in care homes in Wandsworth's local authority may not be an ideal choice due to a low Return on Investment (ROI) of 0.51% and an "Avoid" investment grade. However, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" (96.7%) and "Outstanding" (3.3%) could indicate a reliable and quality service provision. The relatively low percentage of the population aged 65+ (9.91%) may also impact the demand for care home services in the area.
