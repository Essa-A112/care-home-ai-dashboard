Investing in care homes in the Local Authority of Salford may not be the most attractive option due to its current investment grade and other key factors. While the ROI stands at 11.44%, the relatively low percentage of residents aged 65+ and the lack of care homes rated as Outstanding could pose challenges for potential investors. It is advisable to explore other investment opportunities that align better with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
