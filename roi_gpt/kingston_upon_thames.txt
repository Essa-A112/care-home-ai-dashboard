Investing in care homes in Kingston upon Thames may not be the most attractive option due to the relatively low ROI of 2.11% and an overall investment grade of "Avoid." While the percentage of aged 65+ population is moderate at 14.89%, the high percentage of care homes rated as "Good" at 84.1% may provide some reassurance to potential investors. However, the limited number of care homes rated as "Outstanding" at 9.1% suggests there may be challenges in achieving exceptional returns in this market. Proceed with caution and conduct further research before making any investment decisions in this area.
