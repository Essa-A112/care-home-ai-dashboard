The care home investment potential in Tunbridge Wells' Local Authority may have some appeal due to the 10.92% ROI and a relatively high percentage of care homes rated as Good (83.9%).

Considering the aging population in the area (20.03% aged 65+), potential investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.
