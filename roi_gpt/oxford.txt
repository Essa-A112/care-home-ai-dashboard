Investing in care homes in the Local Authority of Oxford may not be advisable at this time due to a negative return on investment of -23.48% and an overall investment grade of "Avoid." While the percentage of residents aged 65 and above is relatively low at 12.0%, the high percentage of care homes rated "Good" at 88.2% could be a potential positive factor to consider. However, with no care homes rated "Outstanding," it may be wise to explore other investment opportunities in this area.
