The care home investment potential in the Local Authority of Hounslow may not be as favorable compared to other areas, with a relatively low ROI of 3.69% and an "Avoid" investment grade. Despite a decent percentage of care homes rated as Good (60.5%) and some rated as Outstanding (10.5%), the relatively low percentage of the population aged 65+ at 12.01% may impact the demand for care home services in this area. Consider exploring other locations with potentially higher investment returns and stronger market conditions for care home investments.
