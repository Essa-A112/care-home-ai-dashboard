Investing in care homes in South Gloucestershire may not be the most lucrative opportunity as the return on investment is relatively low at 0.59%. However, the area does have a significant percentage of the population aged 65 and over, which could potentially drive demand for care services. It's worth noting that a large proportion of care homes in the area are rated as Good, with a smaller percentage rated as Outstanding, suggesting a generally positive quality of care. Overall, while the investment grade is advised as Avoid, the demographics and quality of care facilities in South Gloucestershire could still present some opportunities for investors to consider.
