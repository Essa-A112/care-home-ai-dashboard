Investing in care homes in the Local Authority of Sefton may not be ideal due to the low Return on Investment (ROI) of 2.86% and the "Avoid" investment grade. However, the relatively high percentage of the population aged 65+ at 23.63% suggests a potential demand for care facilities. Additionally, the majority of care homes in the area are rated as "Good" at 78.5%, with a smaller percentage rated as "Outstanding" at 2.5%. Consider these factors carefully when evaluating investment opportunities in the care home sector in Sefton.
